       " \"Vince,UK VAR breached the limit last week.UK traders asked us to review the correlations across UK gas and power aswell as the correlations across EFA slots.We did part of the work last week.Now we'll update the correlations based on historical prices.Tanya.Richard LewisLeppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT,Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Port/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, TedMurphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Simon Hastings/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul D'Arcy/LON/ECT@ECT, AmirGhodsian/LON/ECT@ECTThanks Tanya, these are interesting results.  I am on vacation next week, sohere are my current thoughts.  I am contactable on my mobile if necessary.Gas to power correlationsI see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting VAR for theconservative 30% long term correlation, combined VAR is o1mm less thanpreviously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach?  Strictlyspeaking, we are still over our UK power limit, but the limit was set when wewere assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio VAR.A suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the UKGas and Power books-can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction inportfolio VAR  - ie [Reduction = Portfolio VAR - sum(Power VAR + Gas VAR)]?Also, if I understand your mail correctly, Matrix 1 implies 55% gas powercorrelation is consistent with our correlation curves, and this reduces totalVAR by o1.8mm.EFA slot correlationsThe issue of whether our existing EFA to EFA correlation matrix is correct isa separate issue.  I don't understand where the Matrix 2 EFA to EFAcorrelations come from, but I am happy for you to run some historicalcorrelations from the forward curves (use the first 2 years, I wouldsuggest).  Our original matrix was based on historicals, but the analysis isworth doing again.  Your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how importantthese correlations are.Closing thoughtsFriday's trading left us longer so I would not expect a limit breach onMonday.  We are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve, and I'dlike to wait until both Simon Hastings and I are back in the office (Mondayweek) before finalising this.RegardsRichardTanya TamarchenkoNew/LON/ECT@ECT, Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, KirsteeHewitt/LON/ECT@ECT, Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Port/MarketRisk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECTEverybody,Oliver  sent us the VAR number for different correlations for UK-Powerportfolio separately from UK-Gas portfolio.First, if VAR is calculated accurately the correlation between Power and Gascurves should not affect VAR number for Power and VAR number for Gas, onlythe aggregate number will be affected. The changes you see are due to thefact that we use Monte-Carlo simulation method,which accuracy depends on the number of simulations. Even if we don't changethe correlations but use different realizations of random numbers,we get slightly different result from the model.we should look at the aggregate number.I calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves I got from Paul. As theweights along the term structure I used the product of price, position andvolatility for each time bucket for Gas and each of EFA slots. The resultsInserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix producednegatively definite correlation matrix, which brakes VAR engine.Correlation matrix for any set of random variables is non-negative bydefinition, and remains non-negatively definite if calculated properly basedon any historical data.Here, according to our phone discussion, we started experimenting withcorrelations, assuming the same correlation for each EFA slot and ET Elecversus Gas. I am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results. Inaddition to the aggregate VAR numbers for the runs Oliver did, you can seethe VAR numbers based on correlation Matrix 1 and Matrix 2. In Matrix 1 thecorrelations across EFA slots are identical to these in original matrix.I obtained this matrix by trial and error. Matrix 2 is produces by Naveenusing Finger's algorithm, it differs from original matrix across EFA slots aswellas in Power versus Gas correlations and gives higher VAR than matrix 1 does.calculate historical correlations from them.Tanya.Oliver GaylardLeppard/LON/ECT@ECT, Rudy Dautel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kirstee Hewitt/LON/ECT@ECT,Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECT, DavidPort/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRONCorrelation  VaR-UK Power book       VaR- UK Gas book0.0  o10.405MM       o3.180MM0.1  o10.134MM       o3.197MM0.2  o10.270MM       o3.185MM0.3  o10.030MM       o3.245MM0.4  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)0.5  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)0.6  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)0.7  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)0.8  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)0.9  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)1.0  Cholesky decomposition failed (Not positive definite)Peaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix'sintegrity.Interesting to note that for a higher correlation of 0.2 the power VaRincreases which is counter to intuition.  This implies that we need to lookinto how the correlations are being applied within the model. Once we canderive single correlations from the term structure, is the next action tounderstand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the P+Lvolatility in the spread option deals.From 0.4 onwards the VaR calculation failed.Oliver\",\n",

Ten gas-firedplants, with a total generation capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts, arealready under construction.Over the past three months plans to build or expand interstate lines carryinggas to California have been announced by Sempra Energy unit SouthernCalifornia Gas Co., Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos\\' unit Kern RiverTransmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave PipelineCo., Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. and Kinder Morgan .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), ReliantEnergy Power Generation (REI) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), and the Electric PowerSupply Association.EPSA, which represents competitive power producers and marketers, is\"thrilled\" that FERC will address the issue, said spokesman Mark Stultz.Addressing the seams issue is \"critical with regard to allowing RTOs tofunction and to enhance the movement of electricity across the country,\"Stultz said.\"If you\\'re moving toward a national grid, as the administration has proposedin its national energy policy, you want to make sure you don\\'t havedisconnects at the seams of these RTOs,\" he said.\"The more standardized the business practices for the grid the better,\" saidStultz.In March, the commission sought comment on whether to hold the technicalconference. At the time, Commissioner William Massey welcomed the move,noting that the lack of standardized procedures could pose \"an impediment totrade.\"Massey called for FERC to shepherd an industrywide effort to developconsistent standards for information and terminology regarding scheduling andreservation of transmission capacity among RTOs - including the developmentof \"generic interface procedures.\"FERC spurred a similar standardization process in the natural gas industry,which resulted in creation of a Gas Industry Standards Board, or GISB.GISB produced uniform communications protocols for reserving pipelinecapacity and standardized business practices, Massey noted, expressing thedesire for the electric industry to do the same.

(ENE), Powergen PLC (PWG) and TXU Corp (TXU).In April, the Crown Estates granted an option for the building of up to 13offshore power projects, which together could produce up to 1,500 megawattsof electricity to around one million households.The decision to halt the Humble Hill project took the wind power industry bysurprise, given the strong support of wind energy by the U.K. government,which aims to achieve 10% of power generation from renewable sources by 2010.Also, in February, Energy Minister Peter Hain announced plans to cut red tapefor wind-energy projects. The results of a consultation with the industry forthe creation of a one-stop-shop to facilitate speedy approval of the newwind-farm projects is due within days.However, the Ministry of Defense said the objections brought against HumbleHill could apply potentially to other projects, including some of theoffshore wind projects.\"We will assess wind farms on a case-by-case basis,\" a Ministry of Defensespokesman told Dow Jones Newswires.In addition to wind farms located within reach of surveillance radars,projects within a Tactical Training Area, where aircraft can be flown at 100feet above ground level, may also face opposition from the Ministry ofDefense.However, the Ministry said there was no \"blanket ban\" and that wind projectslocated close to a radar had been given the go-ahead in the past.Companies that may be affected by these developments include Scottish PowerPLC (SPW), Royal/Dutch Shell and Elsam AS, which together plan to place up to90 wind turbines seven kilometers offshore Cleveleys in Lancashire.Although the Ministry of Defense hasn\\'t raised formal objections so far, ithas notified developers that the project is located within scope of amilitary radar, a Scottish Power spokesman said.\"The news from the Ministry of Defense is quite disquieting,\" a spokeswomanfor the British Wind Energy Association said.-By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; 44-20-7842-9283;germana.canzi@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

This came five days after the MSEB notified thecompany it was canceling an agreement to buy power.The western Indian state of Maharashtra would not suffer a power shortagefollowing the state utility\\'s decision to stop buying Dabhol electricity, theboard official said.However, a Dabhol Power Company spokesman declined to comment on the statusof the plant, located 210 miles south of Bombay.The company had earlier said the state-run utility had no legal right tocancel the purchase agreement.Federal and state officials are currently negotiating with the state utilityand Enron officials about the power purchasing agreement.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If others find Planner / CPLEX best suited to their application, Isee no problem is their use of a different system - both have strengths, andit is likely that I would use Planner/CPLEX myself on some future project ifwe were to have both systems available.XPRESS is particularly suited to my application because it handles SpecialOrdered Sets.

It has some significant limitations,and does not permit access to all CPLEX features.All software purchases made by Enron this year will be at 30% off the listprice - we do not need to make a single purchase of any specific quantity oflicenses to obtain this discount.90 days of full maintenance services will be provided with the purchase.The EMOSL utility will be provided at no cost.The XBSL system will be provided at no cost when it is released in a fewweeks time.One development license, hyper version, with modeller, primal/dual simplex,MIP search, dlls, EMOSL and XBSL when available.List price $10,000  Discounted price  $7,000Two run time licenses for above,List price total $8,000    Discounted price  $5,600Total cost  $12,600I've used the usually security request system to set the purchase processgoing, should you agree to this.Tom.\",\n",

Gray Davis said Monday he and legislative leaders wouldhave a plan by week\\'s end to avert the bankruptcy of the state\\'s twobiggestutilities by trading ratepayer-backed bond money for utility assets.\"The drop-dead date is clearly Feb. 12,\" Davis said. That is when a federaljudge is set to hear a lawsuit by Southern California Edison, joined byPacific Gas & Electric, that could lead to sharp rate hikes for consumersunless a rescue plan is in place.Momentum has been building for a plan in which the state would get controlof the utility transmission lines in return for issuing bonds to give theutilities a cash infusion.But Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), who argues thatCalifornia should take control of the transmission grid, said he did notshare Davis\\' urgency to cut a deal this week.The wrangling comes as the state faces the end early Wednesday of whatlikely is the last federal emergency order requiring that independent powergenerators sell electricity in California. The Bush administration insistsit will not extend the order.\"We\\'re not even asking,\" Davis spokesman Steven Maviglio said.Several such orders issued in the past two months have forced powergenerators to keep electricity flowing to California, even though EdisonandPG&E were unable to pay the skyrocketing wholesale costs of electricity.But the federal emergency orders are less vital now that California hasrelieved the utilities of having to buy power--at a cost to taxpayers ofroughly $45 million a day.Davis, meanwhile, plans to announce today that California has entered intoits first long-term contracts to buy power from independent generators,thereby beginning its shift away from the reliance on spot markets.At least one firm, Calpine Corp., was on the verge late Monday of signing adeal to provide the state with up to 1,000 megawatts for roughly 10 years.One megawatt is enough to serve roughly 1,000 homes. The cost could not bedetermined, but it is believed to be slightly above the 5.5 cents perkilowatt-hour that Davis had hoped for.\"Clearly, we are no longer waiting for someone else to solve our problem ordo something to bail us out,\" Davis said at a Capitol news conferenceMonday.\"We are doing everything within our power as a state to right this ship.We\\'re not waiting for someone to throw us a long pass. We\\'re going to solveit ourselves.\"Davis said he will confer with Democratic and Republican legislativeleadersthis week to resolve the complex and controversial issue of providing \"acash infusion to the utilities so they can be viable,\" in exchange forutility assets.The Democratic governor said he is not sure how the state will help thefinancially hobbled companies. It may sell bonds, or guarantee bonds thatthe utilities might sell.Either way, the bonds would give the utilities cash to help them pay downtheir debt, estimated at between $6 billion and $12 billion.\"It cannot be done without assistance from the state,\" Davis said.Though Burton favors taking over the transmission grid, Davis supportstaking equity stakes in the companies themselves in the form of warrants,similar to stock options. The warrants could be cashed in after theutilities regain their stability and used to lower the cost of electricityfor consumers, or to soften future rate hikes.\"That state assistance, no matter what form it comes in, has a value,\"Davissaid. \"It is my goal to make sure that whatever the state receives inreturnhas comparable value.\"Davis signed legislation last week allowing the state to sell an estimated$10 billion worth of bonds to buy power in the future. The bonds would bepurchased by investors, who would be repaid over time by the ratepayers.By selling bonds, the state in essence will be subsidizing consumers forthehigh prices of electricity in the first year or two. But consumers will payhigher prices in later years when the cost of electricity is likely to dropas more power plants are built.In addition to selling bonds to pay for power in the future, Davis said,thestate likely will sell bonds to help the utilities defray the past cost ofpower.State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who will oversee the bond process, said inan interview that the state had little choice but to sell bonds for futurepower purchases. But he said resolving the \"past debts of the utilities\" isa tougher problem.\"There is no magic money here. Bonds require a repayment source,\" Angelidessaid. \"It needs to be a buyout versus a bailout.\"The Democratic treasurer said that only after coming up with their ownreorganization plan should the utilities seek state assistance.\"At the end of the day, if there are some assets of value that we areinterested in as a buyer . . . that should be on the table.\"Edison and PG&E have run up billions in debt in recent months as they paidrecord high prices for wholesale power, yet were unable to pass on the fullcost of it to consumers.On Monday, a federal judge in Los Angeles is scheduled to rule on Edison\\'ssuit alleging that the California Public Utilities Commission must allowtheutilities to pass on the multibillion-dollar cost of buying power.Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), among the lawmakers mostinvolvedin the Legislature\\'s response to the energy crisis, said that if utilitieswin the suit and are allowed to pass on the full cost of their powerpurchases, consumers could be hit with an 86% rate increase.\"I don\\'t think we can roll the dice and let that happen,\" said Keeley, whoalong with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) has been pushingfor an early settlement of the Edison lawsuit.However, Burton, the Legislature\\'s most influential member, shrugged offtheMonday deadline.\"Trial courts rule. Appellate courts rule. Supreme Courts rule, and it\\'sthree or four years down the road,\" Burton said.* Davis again used his emergency authority to claim $150 million worth ofcontracts held by PG&E, shortly before they would have been taken by one ofthe utility\\'s creditors.PG&E had defaulted on payments to the California Power Exchange, and theentity, a sort of commodities market for electricity, wanted to auction offthe contracts. Davis took similar action with Edison contracts Friday.The PG&E contracts will supply between 100 and 500 megawatts of electricityfor the remainder of 2001. The price of the power will be determined inproceedings before the state Board of Control. But the state may finditselfpaying significantly more than the relative low prices specified in thecontracts.* Edison revealed that one of its bank accounts was seized last month by acreditor, General ReFinancial Products Corp., which contends it is owed$8.8million for early termination of a financial arrangement during theutility\\'s debt crisis.Edison said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissionthat it has asked the federal court that gave the creditor permission toattach the account to reverse course and stop the action. The account, witha New York bank, contains $1.5 million, Edison said.Edison noted in the same filing that it had $1.36 billion in cash onMonday,but has defaulted on several million dollars\\' worth of debt payments andhas\"deferred\" payments totaling $743 million through Monday to electricitysuppliers.If the Rosemead utility had made all of its debt and electricity paymentsasthey came due, it would have run out of cash last Friday, Edison said. Incontrast, its parent company, Edison International is paying all of itsbills.* Shares of Edison International rose 22 cents to close at $13.23 per shareMonday and PG&E Corp. fell 14 cents to close at $13.60 per share. Bothtradeon the New York Stock Exchange.Standard & Poor\\'s, a large credit rating agency, reaffirmed thatCalifornia\\'s strong rating remains on its \"Credit Watch Negative\" listfollowing Thursday\\'s passage by the Legislature of a bill giving the stateDepartment of Water Resources $500 million more to buy electricity for thestate.California\\'s general obligation bonds carry a rating of double-A.* S&P also downgraded to \"D\"--or junk-bond level--the \"issuer creditrating\"of the California Independent System Operator, reflecting the fact that theutilities are no longer paying their electricity bills.The downgrade does not affect any operating funds of Cal-ISO, which aregenerated by transmission fees, and does not include debt issued by thestate for Cal-ISO, which retains \"insured triple-A\" and \"A-1 plus\" ratings.- Picture- Picture- Picture- Picture- Picture',\n",

After the DCCircuit Court decided the case in March 2000, EPA asked the court to lift thestay on the NOx SIP submittal for States and give the states the same amountof time they would have had to submit their SIPs, had the stay not beenimposed in the first place.   Industry sources opposed lifting the stay, andalso asked the court to move the complaince deadline back a year, due to thedelays caused by the litigation.The Court lifted the stay on June 22, 2000, but was silent on the issue ofthe compliance deadline.  States are now required to develop their \"StateImplementation Plans\" (SIPs) by October 31, 2000.Yesterday, the Court decided that sources should have until May 2004 tocomply, giving sources an extra year to prepare for the new regulatory regime.Remaining QuestionsWith the previous 2003 compliance deadline, the NOx SIP Call regulations wereon the same time schedule as the Section 126 petitions, which were approvedby EPA (though a separate regulatory process -- a nearly-identical fallbackto the NOx SIP call) for many of the same sources and states as the NOx SIPCall.   The Section 126 Rule is going to be litigated starting this comingNovember, but the Court has not yet issued a stay of those regulation, norhas it delayed the compliance deadline to 2003.   Unless the Court places astay on the 126 Rule and delays the compliance deadline to 2004, sourcescould still be required to make substantial NOx reductions starting in May2003.   We expect the Courts to resolve this issue sometime before the 126litigation commences in early November.Enron ActivitiesSIPs are being developed by the states, with a deadline of October 31, soEnvironmental Strategies will be spending the next few months working toensure that the rules that are crafted in the states provide the mostfavorable treatment possible for our assets while providing a competitiveadvantage to our traders.

       " 'T Paul Johnson@ENRONA number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted onbehalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which wesummarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these casesas quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outsidecounsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and willneed to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we havebeen made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices.Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we havebeen able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile (\"Codelco\" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAGand MGCCThis is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean statecopper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, butalso against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contractson the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to themain Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claimfrom Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML,which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd hasNO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this documentand its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be madesubject to prior approval by legal.Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware,High Court proceedings take place in public.- LT010810084_3.doc2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National CorporationClaim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on clientcontracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China.3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing HouseClaim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Lossesbelieved to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard aspreliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time barinapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations withStandard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally(and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recentoffer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject toLMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss beingestablished now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, andhave therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgentbasis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC byPhoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assumepossibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaitingadvice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should becomesufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are knownto exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LMEwarrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involvessignificant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed inarbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH(and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceedthe amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.',\n",

A copy of my Aug. 22 summary is attached for your reference.  I've discussed this with Elizabeth Sager and Harlan Murphy in ENA Legal, and the following is a very brief summary of aspects of the NOPR that we think Enron should consider opposing.  Comments are due Oct. 5.If approved, FERC's proposed revisions would affect Enron by requiring electronic posting of certain transactional data by power marketers and entities selling at wholesale pursuant to market-based rate authority.- identification of the buyer/seller;- description of the service, (e.g., purchase/sale, firm/non-firm);- delivery point(s);- price(s) (price per transaction rather than price ranges)- quantities, (e.g., MWh/MW); and- dates/duration of service (e.g., daily, monthly, hourly, etc.)Such information is supposed to be reported on a transaction by transaction (rather than aggregated) basis.  The quarterly filings are paper filings and are not granted confidential treatment.The quarterly filing requirements proposed in the NOPR differ in that they would, 1) in addition to all of the above information, also require posting of the transaction execution date and the point of receipt; 2) require electronic posting of an Index of Customers rather than paper filing and 3) require reporting for all sales transactions including book outs or net outs.  Enron should consider objecting to these revisions.  I've spoken with some of the traders and they agree.  The effect of these requirements would be that Enron's competitors will now have quicker, easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction.  FERC has cited very little valid justification for imposing these new requirements.ENA Legal representatives and I will be participating in the EPSA conference call to discuss the NOPR on Friday.  I would like to have a consensus on Enron's general position by then.  I do not know whether we will be joining EPSA's comments or filing on our own.  Please let me know your thoughts and call me if you would like to discuss.  Also, if you don't already have information on the EPSA conference call and want to participate, let me know and I can provide you with the call-in number and agenda.SSL\",\n",

During our meeting, Stewart and I discussed some concerns about BPA transmission such as load following service, 10-min dispatch for A/S, how BPA's decremental cost is calculated, control area reserves, and line losses.  He suggested we put together a list of transmission issues/requests for products that he could present to TBL on our behalf.  He said it would be more effective for us to give him a written document, as opposed to just having him relay our oral comments.Please send me any suggestions you have for improving TBL's services.  If you will provide me with something to start with, I would be happy to polish it up and include it with the rest of our issues.Obviously, TBL moves slowly so it is unlikely that any changes would happen immediately.  However, TBL has a one-year rate case every other year.  Next year is that year, so if we get our ideas in the hopper this year, we might see some of them in TBL's next rate proposal.Steve\",\n",

       " \"Becky --My only question is one of emphasis.  Are points 3&4 the key for Barry T.?  If so, should we move them up higher?  Also, why the very lenghthy discussion of pooling points?  The length makes the points after that discussion hard to appreciate.  Maybe a list of bullet points up front?Jim-----Original Message-----Please review the attached filing and provide any comments you may have by COB Friday, 10/5.The filing is ENA's comments on El Paso's proposal for receipt point allocation, focusing on discussions at the two technical conferences in the proceeding.  Also, it may be that, based on further discussion with certain other shippers, we will modify our statement in Item No. 1 to to support a different version of the method for allocating receipt point rights, but only if there is strong opposition to our method.  We don't want FERC to select the method that El Paso proposed originally.\",\n",

Over the past year, thisforest, the largest remnant of intact primary dry tropical forest in theworld, has been bisected by a 30-ft.-wide gash for construction of a gaspipeline by Enron and Shell. Enron in its quest for profit has ignored thescientific advice of conservation organizations to maintain the ecologicalintegrity of this endangered forest ecosystem. Enron and Shell decided toopen the 10 million- acre forest to fragmentation and deforestation by theirpipeline.

PATRICIA CAFFREY World Wildlife Fund-BoliviaSanta Cruz, BoliviaArena foes launch bid to defeat new planBy ERIC BERGERCopyright 2000 Houston ChronicleWednesday, October 4, 2000A handful of activists, including a Harris County Green Party official andseveral low-tax proponents, launched an effort Tuesday to defeat a secondplan to build a downtown arena.Unlike the 1999 opposition campaign, this year\\'s anti-arena movement is notseeking a better financing deal for taxpayers. These activists want no arenaat all.Although this year\\'s opponents lack the nearly $700,000 their higher-profilepredecessors spent last year, that has done little to diminish theirrhetoric.\"Should we spend our city\\'s limited resources on building up rich guys, or dowe spend it building up our communities?\" asked activist DeWayne Lark,standing in front of City Hall. \"There will be no more corporate welfare inHarris County.\"Pro-arena campaign officials said Tuesday\\'s event, which came about threeweeks after their own kickoff, was more notable for who did not attend thanfor who did.Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson, who funded a large chunk of last year\\'santi-arena effort, has endorsed the new deal. Gracie Saenz, a former citycouncilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the 1999 deal, alsosupports the new agreement.And although the Harris County Republican Party -- the primary organizer ofthe 1999 anti-arena effort -- has declined to support the new deal, it hasnot been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped.In the GOP\\'s stead this year is the Harris County Green Party, represented byNathalie Paravicini, who said she rejects the argument that professionalsports are critical to a city\\'s identity.Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houston\\'s image as aworld-class city.\"Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town atthe drop of a hat,\" she said.And organizers of the anti-arena campaign also suggested that conservativepolitical activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a majorrole in their efforts, possibly becoming campaign manager.Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the pro-arenacampaign co-chairmen, Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay andformer Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, he comes from a politically activefamily that can raise large amounts of money.Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in buildingsports stadiums, but he has declined to say how much he was willing to getinvolved in the anti-arena effort.Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight thearena. The group is expected to form a political action committee this weekto collect contributions.The philosophy of the anti-sports-arena efforts has reverted to its 1996form, when a similar grass-roots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum tobuild a baseball stadium, which voters approved. That underfunded effort alsoopposed any public spending on stadiums, rather than merely trying to extracta better deal from team owners.Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes, andcertainly the best-known, to their ranks by altering the original proposal,which failed with voters last year by 10 percentage points.Still, they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in high-profilecontests.\"We never expected this to be a unanimous vote,\" said Jordan, the co-chairmanof the pro-arena campaign, Let\\'s Build it Together. \"Some people will voteagainst anything.\"By Stuart Penson10/03/2000Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2000.PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Online trading is set to sweep through Europe\\'spower markets, sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressureon traditional brokers, industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday.Scores of web-based trading platforms, offering a variety of functions, areexpected to enter the European wholesale power market in the near term,forcing brokers who work over the telephone to rethink their approach, theytold an energy conference.\"Transaction fees in Europe are already falling and I think we\\'re going tosee a big decline over the next six months,\" said Gilbert Toppin, principalof Deloitte Consulting\\'s European e-business practice.\"Voice broking could become a distant memory,\" he told Reuters during thePowerisk 2000 conference.Leading the online charge in Europe\\'s wholesale power market are EnronOnline,which launched last year, and HoustonStreet.com, which started up last weekand is already planning to expand into Scandinavia.EnronOnline is a bilateral market in which Enron is always one party to adeal. HoustonStreet is a multilateral exchange.The major advantages for online markets over telephone brokers are seen aslower transaction costs and the ability to display a far wider range ofprices to clients.Also, online trading is anonymous, which is attractive to traders, said MarkCrosno, president of electronic trading services at Altra Energy Technologiesof the US.Altra is a partner with National Grid in EnMO in the UK, a consortium whichruns a screen-based gas trading market and is planning to launch a powerexchange.Many traditional brokers are still deciding how to respond to the onlinechallenge.\"A lot of brokers are scratching their heads because there are going to be 20or 25 electronic exchanges out there,\" said Per-Otto Wold, managing directorof Natsource-Tullett Europe, one of Europe\\'s biggest power brokers.Wold argued that doing a trade over the telephone was still, in most cases,the quickest method. And that would remain so until voice recognition enabledtraders to \"talk\" to the screens on their desks.He expected brokers to focus on longer dated trades and options while onlinemarkets would capture a greater share of trading in short term, high volumecontracts.The provision of market information and traders\\' liking for personal contactover the telephone would also help to preserve a niche for the voice brokers,said Wold.\"The markets are still going to need somebody to massage the markets, andthat is where the brokers come in,\" he said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and arethere limitations during start-ups.Start-up emissions vary and can not accurately be measured due to theinherent delay time in the CEMS system.  Additionally, start-up emissions arenot required to be and in fact were not measured during the stack testing.There are no limitations on emissions during start-up evolutions, since thepermits at both plants allow exceptions to exceedences during start-ups andshutdowns.Unit #1 = 78.95 ppmcUnit #2 = 79.49 ppmcUnit #3 = 87.58 ppmcUnit #4 = 89.48 ppmcTDEC Operating Permit #950748F special condition #5 requires that BrownsvillePower 1 L.L.C. (BPI) operate at 0.057 #/MMBtu and 0.090 #/MMBtu for units#1-2 and #3-4 respectively, with a total NOx emission limit of 249 Total Tonsper Year.  The TDEC Division of Air Pollution Control regulation chapter1200-3-20-.02 (1) regulates the reasonable measures required to keep emissionto a minimum during startups, shutdowns and malfuntions.  There is no SpecialCondition outling rolling averages or compliance with a certain time limitfor NOx emissions otherthan \"Reasonable Measures Required.\"2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?Brownsville Power was issued a Tennesse Multi-Sector General Permit (TMGP)#TNR05XXX for Storm Water Discharges associated with Industrial Activity. Mr.Jacke Wade, TDEC Division of Water Pollution stated that if the NOV\\'s werenot satisfied after July 1, 2000 a new TDEC rule was being promulgated toconvert the TMGP back into a Storm Water permit during construction.  Ibelieve the NOV\\'s have been satisified and can therefore request TDEC toterminate the TMGP.  Due to BPI\\'s sic code of 4911, it is my understandingthat we are not required to maintain an Industrial storm water permit orSPDES permit.Caledonia3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?The fuel monitoring schedule has been monthly from Comercial Operation 6-7-00through 4-00.  Then in accordance with the TDEC letter dated 9-10-99Brownsville Power was granted a custom fuel monitoring schedule.  Theschedule consists of sulfur monitoring conducted twice monthly for sixmonths; then sulfur monitoring conducted once per quarter for six quarters;iffuel analyses show little variability the samples will be conducted twiceannually during the first and third quarters of each calendar year.Brownsville4.  What is the agency\\'s response to the Enron letter regarding the 2ndstormwater NOV?I spoke with Mr. Jacke Wade on 6-14-00 and requested he visit the site toinspect the work completed.  His response was \" I will inspect the facilityas time permits and if I do not show up on your door step your o.k.\"  I havenot heard from him to date.5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwaterNOV was never responded to?Not to my knowledge other than issuance of the 2nd NOV dated 5-1-00.6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was thatduring construction only or is it ongoing?I do not recall specifically wetland being mentioned, but the TDEC letterdated 2-22-99 and 5-1-00 refers to the \"sediment retention basin\".  In myinternal memo to Mitch Robinson dated 9-14-00 I outlined the correctivemeasures which included the excavation of the holding pond (sedimentretention pond) and build a spillway for sediment retention.7.

       " 'CONFIDENTIAL/ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGEI have given considerable thought to the issue you raised in themeeting on June 15 -- that is, whether the amount of Available Cash for thefourth quarter of 1999 could be recomputed so that the issuance of APIs forthat quarter could be rescinded.  My delay in getting back to you wasoccasioned by the fact that I went on vacation shortly after that meetingand just returned to work yesterday.The reason the question is worth exploring is this --- Enron Corp.has certain rights under its support agreement with EOTT, and it is entitledto exercise those rights notwithstanding the fact that it also has afiduciary duty as a controlling shareholder.  I approached the questionsolely as counsel for Enron and from the standpoint of evaluating the meritsof any claim that Enron could make that the API issuance should bewere dealing with an unrelated third party would that third party have aclaim for rescission?  Unfortunately, based on the facts as I understandthem, I have been unable to formulate a claim that has sufficient merit tobe worthy of assertion, as explained below.The computation of Available Cash for any quarter is based on (a)cash receipts and disbursements and (b) increases or reductions in cashreserves, which the General Partner \"determines in its reasonable discretionto be necessary or appropriate.\"  Thus, the question is whether there is abasis for recomputing the cash receipts or the reserves for the fourthquarter.Cash Receipts.  I would think there may well be a valid claim in asituation in which EOTT made a mistake in its calculations of cash receiptsor disbursements, even if that mistake was discovered several months later.It is my understanding, however, that the scrub-down of the books for thefourth quarter turned up only immaterial discrepancies from the amounts thathad been calculated for the fourth quarter in mid-February, when thedistribution of Available Cash for the quarter was made.  Thus, I am awareof no meritorious argument that Enron is entitled to rescission because ofEOTT\\'s mistakes in calculating its cash receipts or disbursements for thequarter.   That being the case, the only other issue that is worth focusingon is the reserves.Reserves.  The only component of the reserves that I am aware ofthat is large enough to bear scrutiny is the theft-related insurance item.There were no cash receipts from the insurance prior to the distribution, soany claim for rescission must focus on the amount of reserves for the fourthquarter.  If the level of reserves was determined in a manner that was notconsistent with the \"reasonable discretion\" standard set forth in thepartnership agreement, Enron would have a valid claim for rescission.Presumably had the General Partner known in mid-February that insurancewould cover the $3 million loss (other than the $500,000 deductible), itwould have reduced reserves by $2.5 million (either by setting aside less inreserves or releasing reserves established in prior quarters), which wouldhave produced $2.5 million of additional Available Cash.  In that case therewould not have been any APIs required.  Is there a basis for a claim thatthe General Partner did not use \"reasonable discretion\" when it establishedthe level of reserves?  Based on the facts as I understand them, I have beenunable to come up with a good argument that the General Partner was notusing its \"reasonable discretion\" in making the determination it made.   Itis my understanding that, although at the time the General Partner was awarethat it had theft insurance, it did not know whether the insurance wouldcover the entire $3 million loss or merely the $800,000 in fair market valueof the product at the time of the theft (less the $500,000 deductible).  Ialso understand that the insurance carrier had not admitted liability atthat time, so there was some question whether there would be any insuranceproceeds.  Thus, it seems it would be very difficult to establish that theGeneral Partner did not use its reasonable discretion.The partnership agreement makes it clear that the amount ofAvailable Cash is to be computed based on (a) actual receipts anddisbursements during the quarter and (b) distributions from the operatingpartnerships and reserves established, or changes in reserves, that in eachcase occur prior to the \"date on which the Partnership makes itsdistribution of Available Cash in respect of such quarter.\"  Thus, thepartnership agreement leaves no room for going back and redoing reservesbased on events that occur after the distribution for the quarter.Please call if you have any questions about this analysis or if youthink I do not have my facts straight or need additional facts.

Since these customers receive power servicesfrom their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and itwouldn\\'t be fair to require them to pay for it.Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power butsubsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided byDWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buyingpower but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would onlybe responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place fromJan. 17th thru April 30th.I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that tookplace over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn\\'t explicitly agree during thetalks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agreepretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can createunnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we includevery clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying whatcustomers\\' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers withincentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that itfinds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive toswitch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net shortposition that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, therebyreducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricitypurchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.With this in mind, I\\'m also proposing that the group consider an amendment tothe bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switchesto Direct Access by September 1st.Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend DirectAccess is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, thatseems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And ifthat\\'s the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for andpassage of the \"core/noncore\" proposal.Best,Jeff',\n",

Let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,Kim-----Original Message-----Dear Potential Gas SupplierAs some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreementwill come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor currentcommitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able touse the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happeningis that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowingdelegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the CityCouncil that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind ofagreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved bythe City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by ourBoard and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keepus operating.I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we arecontracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the newyear begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will becomfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make anychanges to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about theavailability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone wehave already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all ourboilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are tryingto do here.I Hope most of you will respond.

I recognize and sympathize with the strainyour group is under with all the systems problems, the UK DPR  issues, theincreased limit change and policy compliance activity, etc..  My suggestionsgathering process easier, 2) I was offering to \"be the bad guy\" and point outto the traders what we want them to do, and 3)meant to strengthen theeffectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant ofincreasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders theiraccountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits.I think the confusion here is  violation explanations being \"validated\" bythe traders as you indicated below, vs. \"provided\" by the traders as weenvision.  I confirmed with Ted, the traders are accountable for providingthe explanation.  I\\'m not sure how the suggestions below would be a set backto your efforts of getting memos out earlier.  We\\'re suggesting the tradersshould provide you with explanations first thing in the morning, so that youdo not have to go through all the effort as you do now, of trying to trackpeople down in the afternoon and get explanations.  It should be the tradersresponsibility to get them to you, and they should be reviewing theirpositions every morning before they even begin trading., and should be ableto easily explain why they\\'re in violation or why they had a big loss.Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail, or theytalk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you- whatever you think makes sense and works for you.   I\\'m not trying tomanage the process, just to help design one that makes it easier for you andis still effective from a risk management stand point.At this point in this long series of e-mails, why don\\'t we just talk face toface.  I can tell from your response you feel we\\'re somehow not being teamplayers, but that is not my intent at all.  I\\'ve tried to go out of my waythe past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values andappreciates your efforts.  And really, I thought I was helping by using thepolicy\\'s influence to help develop a better process that would decrease thetime and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting.Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate.  We can talkabout this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RAC\\'sexpectations.  I agree, we do have significant mid-office needs, and you havebeen absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC;and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional riskreporting is required every day by Skilling.  We can continue to work onstreamlining processes, but maybe we need to think about staffing in ourrespective groups and corresponding responsibilities.  I\\'m willing to dowhatever is needed, and I don\\'t think Ted is hung up on who does whateither.  It\\'s just that right now we\\'re staffed with the expectation thatSally\\'s group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type ofactivities related to our risk management systems.Best Regards,Cassandra.---------------------- Forwarded by Cassandra Schultz/NA/Enron on 12/07/2000Falcone/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Veronica Valdez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTDear Cassandra,Thanks for the message.  I believe it if fully understood by us and theindividual risk management groups that explanations must be validated by thetraders.  Are you in addition saying that your group (who has been veryhelpful in the past) will no longer help us understand the cause ofviolations/notifications?  To me, this appears contrary to a team spiritattitude, and not reflective of what you and I and Vlady and I had discussedearlier today.  Also, we are working toward getting the memos out earlier,and this is a real set back to that process.Thoughts?Abel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daniel Falcone/Corp/Enron@ENRONShona -To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification templatewas not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your groupis working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with yourrequest below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revisedreporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution untilyou are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/Lnotification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesdayshould dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that shouldhelp.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your businessunit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violationexplanations.

At your request, we have startedto prepare this in addition to the normal word violation/notification memosand our other work.  As you have certain requests and requirements, it wouldbe helpful for someone in your group to review it before it went out toensure it meets your requirements.Please let me know if this is workable and who the reviewer should be.Thanks,ShonaWilson/NA/Enron@Enron, Daniel Falcone/Corp/Enron@ENRONI realize this has already gone out, but I see a few errors that we shouldcorrect  - and actually, I think we should call Skilling and Lay\\'s (andBuy\\'s) assistants (Veronica will handle this) and see if we can just handdeliver to them a corrected version early this morning, e-mail is OK for Ted,David and I. I have a few other suggestions on format/reporting changes aswell.The NA Power VaR of $51MM was not 105% over its VaR limit of $50 - that wouldhave been $52.5 to require a report to Skilling, (but if we had had to reportit, don\\'t use \"WSCC\", try to spell out or just don\\'t use)UK Gas\\'s VaR limit is not $4, it\\'s $7.5MMI can\\'t tie in UK Gas\\' QTD and YTD P/L - shouldn\\'t it be what\\'s on the DPR,adjusted for the portion of the structured derivatives that is gas - callover to that Yeo person and get the info. from them pleaseThe 2nd item for NA Gas shouldn\\'t be listed like that as it looks likebottom under RAC commentsThe Finance Committe Chairman notification for Agg. VaR is not 100%, it\\'s115% (notification requirement box)EES had a VaR violation - $7.5 vs. 7 - that is a Skilling level violation2000\"Let\\'s number them all sequentially rather than starting over at each levelVeronica will call you to coordinate re-distribution.Going forward, we need to increase our level of review for these as they\\'regetting a lot of scrutiny given market dynamics and our increasing risk.Thank you,Cassandra.---------------------- Forwarded by Cassandra Schultz/NA/Enron on 12/07/2000Michael BenienSkilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sherri Sera/Corp/Enron@ENRON, RickBuy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Karen K Heathman/HOU/ECT@ECTPort/Market Risk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Chris Abel/HOU/ECT@ECT',\n",

However, are people really thinking, or has Davis and thereporters tainted the waters too badly?  What would be the result that wewould like to get from such an exposee?  Do we really think that we could getsome sympathy for returning to a market based structure?  Or, would we belike the irritating kid who keeps saying \"I told you so\", so it does notmatter if he was right or not?  Are there any legal issues in revealing theprices?  Does doing this through IEP help?  (Note that the addition of pricescould not be done, I do not think,  without naming companies, so we would bethere, partially revealed.)and especially if it can help make even a small amout of progress towards amarket based structure, I would do it.  Of course, we could not go anymore torestaurants near the CPUC......I am out of town for the rest of the week, so I will leave the decision toyou guys.

       " \"James Riley1011 Bross St.longmont, CO 80501jriley@unavco.ucar.eduTo Mr. Ken Lay,I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.Sincerely,James Riley\",\n",

       " \"Tim and Steve,As mentioned by Tim, another alternative would be to not make the prepetition payment and just use the market to settle these obligations.  If the cost of the payment is factored into the cost of the transmission and compared to the cost of a market settlement, the company would benefit by not making the prepetition payment for approximately the next 32 days worth of deliveries.  After this time the company would incur additional costs to deliver at Pinnacle Peak for the remaining term of the WALC obligation.  The term of the WALC agreement is through 12/31/04 and is in the money during LLH for the entire term.-----Original Message-----TimWe are currently using APS transmission to satisfy a LLH short position at Pinnacle Peak.  The revenue associated with the sale at Pinnacle Peak is $45/MWh.  The transmission is used to liquidate a long position at Four Corners 345 against the Pinnacle Peak short position.  The cost of the power purchased at Four Corners is $22.25/MWh.  Using the APS transmission is the most economic liquidation scheme at this time.  Our alternative would be to sell the length below the market value, and buy the short at above market value.  This assumes that we could find a willing buyer and seller. The spread between the purchase and sell price in this scenario is estimated at $5/mwh.  The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95/mwh.Salt River has the facility to provide the same service, but at this time they are unwilling to provide service to Enron.If you have any further questions please contact me.-----Original Message-----what is this transmission for?  how critical is it?-----Original Message-----Chip,I have a new critical vendor with a prepetition invoice.  Arizona Public Service provides us critical transmission between the major trading points in the Southwest.  We owe them $43,708.60 for November transmission charges.  They will cut us if we do not pay.  I have explained that this payment needs to go through the creditor's cash approval process.They can cut us starting tomorrow, but have agreed to a stay if we pay our December invoice of $8,071.20.  I will be faxing this invoice for immediate payment.Steve\",\n",

The easiest way todo that is through the food.\"  She says thatwhen she first came to America, she missed themany joyous family celebrations and their acc-ompanying feasts, and tried to recreate themfor her new friends in America.\"When I first arrived in America, cookingVietnamese dishes was a challenge, becausethere were no Asian food stores in Carlisle PA.Most of the time I could not find the tradi-tional ingredients and had to make substitutions,but the food turned out just fine,\" she says.Diana recorded all of these substitutions inher cookbook, keeping the original tastes andtextures. The recipes make use of ingredientseasily found in local supermarkets, and showstep-by-step instructions for making the healthydelights of Vietnamese cuisine fast and simply.\"My time for cooking is as limited as it everwas when I was a new immigrant,\" Tran says.\"Traditional Vietnamese food can take time andeffort to prepare-time I usually don\\'t have, soI have created my own easier versions of Vietn-amese dishes, tailored to the busy Americanlifestyle.\"Diana\\'s cookbook has been featured in TheWashington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, CharlotteObserver, Arkansas Democrat Gazette, and thePortland Press-Herald.

       " 'Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you\\'ve worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.Deal Terms--\\tThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.--\\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy\\'s outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron\\'s Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy\\'s $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron\\'s Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.Management of Newly Formed CompanyChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company\\'s history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.',\n",

I would like tocatch up with all ofyou.  not sure of people's schedules but please advise me of youravailability and hopemost of you can make it for dinner on thur.  I will list some importantthings to me that I  wouldlike to discuss and propose some thoughts on positive changes for 2001.teamwork/communication/teaching/guidance/leadership -   these are the majorareas we should bethinking about how we can improve.teamwork - I feel we look at each commodity (crude/light distillates/middledistillates/heavy distillates/lpg/petrochemicals) as a separate business.   try to identify team leaders toprovide direction for that business,establish resources required to meet proposed budgets, and work on individuallimits for the traders in thosegroups.communication - once we have established global teams this should improvesignificantly.  'the road to hellis paved with good intentions' and until traders bonuses are directly tied tothe profitability of someone inanother office I don't think we will communicate as effectively we need to.we have very few niche markets toexploit that provide us with guaranteed revenues or allow most of ourphysical traders the ability to trade wellwithout a strong understanding of the push/pull forces at work from the othercenters.   for the last two yearsthis has been cited a main area for improvement.  to get to where we want tobe I feel it has to be done throughglobal books.teaching - given that the growth of the group has shifted away from hiringfrom the outside and toward internalrecruiting we need to focus on how we develop and keep young talent.  also,given the lack of depth in ourtrading group it is important that our best traders be given the additionalresponsibility for development oftalent in their teams.guidance - I feel that if  we move toward smaller business units it will beeasier for individuals to understandwhat the strategy is and what their specific role in that strategy is.  welost a lot of people at this time last yearand the common complaint amongst all of them was they couldn't see where thisgroup was headed.leadership - with a group of 114 people at last count it is important tostart thinking about ways to encouragemore people to make a greater  personal investment in making this group asuccess.  not just meeting abudget but also in creating a  business that will survive the exit of  anyindividual.   a business that will havea competitive advantage and that those involved in it will be highlymotivated to keep growing.if there is consensus on the need to improve upon the above then we cananalyse how we go about it.I believe that by going toward global books we could improve upon many of ourweaknesses.  chemistryis the major concern on a such move but best looked at in context of eachgroup.there are many other important issues such as eol, marketing team, researchgroup, recruitment, etcbut I honestly think we have to focus first on how do we make most with theexisitng group and thenfigure out how to try to build upon it.look forward to seeing you on weds aftn or thursday and please email when/ifyou have free time tomeet up.thanks,chris.\",\n",

See summary below.Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace.Supply/Demand Balance.\"  You may find our conclusions of interest.Best regards,Bob NimocksPresidentZeus Development Corporationwww.zeusdevelopment.com2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250Houston, TX 77042***********************************from a buyer\\'s to a seller\\'s market. Gas supplies for North America ran shortas demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortagesin storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from theU.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf ofMexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation isexpected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning offgas that would have been destined for storage.Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs andexperienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  Thecurrent rig count for North American gas exploration and production is nearfull capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on howquickly it can recover.The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gasin 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas fromNorth Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% oftotal U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plansare underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002;however, more are needed.Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the UnitedStates due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceivedto be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned byCongress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts withAlgeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announcedStates and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria andNorthern Australia might supply these terminals.Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to buildterminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production(IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities onCaribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity viaundersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offera means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental andcommunity concern.The June 27-29 conference, entitled \"LNG\\'s Role in North American & CaribbeanGas Supply,\" will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gassupply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source ofnatural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  Theconference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacitiesand timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshoreterminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in theCaribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity tothe United States.* * *',\n",

She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?

For example, some operating systems stil=l=20have  rules that impose substantial penalties for inaccurate scheduling of==20generation,  even though the real time balancing markets required under FER=C=20Order 2000  should eliminate the need for these penalties. The intermittent==20nature of wind  makes such rules especially burdensome for wind projects.==20?On the bright side, some of the early problems with wind generation are =20successfully being overcome.

In the meantime, Ithought you might appreciate a quick run-down of what actually happened inthe final hours of this year\\'s wild legislative session.The good news is that the public benefit charge bill passed easily with a10-year term and no statutory harm was done.  The bad news is that utilitiescaptured the deregulation debate and successfully painted generators asvillains and the wholesale market as \"broken.\"Major legislative actions on energy matters follow.  If you have anyquestions or would like a copy of final legislation, please call.AB 995 (Wright) and SB 1194 (Sher), which extend public benefit charges forenergy conservation, renewable energy development, and RD&D, passed theState Legislature by large margins.  Recent indications are that theGovernor will sign the bills, although interested companies should join IEPin sending letters urging him to do so.Power plant siting was front and center the last week of the session.  Asrecently as Wednesday of this week, the bill was so bad for new power plantdevelopment that IEP opposed the expedited siting provisions.  They wererewritten by Republican staff and CEC attorneys to provide a 6-month processfor a mitigated negative declaration of environmental impacts that mighthelp those few entities that can start the process in full compliance withlocal rules.  This provision is available for both combined cycle facilitiesand peaking facilities.  The bill also includes a provision for four-monthapproval of amendments to pending applications providing for theinstallation of temporary peaking generation  on sites that will bedeveloped into combined cycle facilities within three years.  The CECexpects this to apply so a single pending application.  Finally, the billincludes language directing the CPUC and the EOB to be helpful on ISO issuesthat affect the willingness self-generators to remain interconnected withthe grid.Utility efforts to craft legislation assuring them of collection of largenegative balances in their Transition Revenue Accounts failed when theycould not reach agreement with representatives of large customer groups.  Inits place, the Legislature passed a non-binding resolution directing theCPUC to investigate the issue and including highly offensive language on$100 price caps and retroactive recalculation of market clearing prices.Legislation establishing a retroactive cap on SDG&E rates and providing noassurance of cost recovery to Sempra passed the Legislature.  Companionlegislation that most observers expect the Governor to veto provides $150million of General Fund money to SDG&E.A draft of so-called \"sunshine\" legislation surfaced late in the process.The draft empowered the Electricity Oversight Board to collect anything itmight be interested in from the ISO, PX, utilities, generators, andmarketers and to treat the information confidentially.  The draft facedunified opposition and did not make its way into any legislation.AB 1002 (Wright) establishing public benefit charges on the natural gassystem passed the Legislature.  It continues to include language exemptingelectricity generation from the charges.Karen Edsonkedson@ns.net916/552-7070',\n",

It wasn\\'t you entering the men\\'s washroomthat caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all thetime. It\\'s rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for.Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just startspinning around; just so I\\'ll make sure I hit something.You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men\\'spenises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall becauseall the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and hispenis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down hisleft pant leg, and onto his shoe. I\\'m telling \\'ya those little buggers can\\'tbe trusted.After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I\\'m no longerallowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee.She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she hadgone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soakedtoilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seatdown, she was going to kill me in my sleep.Now another thing us guys don\\'t usually like to talk about, butbecause you and I have become such good friends and you think I\\'m a classyguy, I might as well be candid with you because it\\'s a real problem, and youladies need to be understanding. It\\'s the dreaded \"morning wood\".Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desireto pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matterhow hard you try, you can\\'t get that thing to bend, and if it won\\'t bend youcan\\'t aim, well hell, if you can\\'t aim you have no choice but to piss allover the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist onputting on the toilet.And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers,the friggin\\' toilet seat won\\'t stay up by itself. So that means we have touse one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to controlour less than perfect aim.Now sometimes, when you\\'re newly married, (and I know the guys inhere will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat withthat damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzything until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then thatcompressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toiletseat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys willnot lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it\\'s just not safe.I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. Itold her... look, it won\\'t bend. She said, \"so sit down like I told you todo all the rest of the time.\" OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with\"morning wood\".Well it\\'s is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, andbefore I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging onthe wall across the room.Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced downunder the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from thecrack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. Youpiss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legson to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floorin front of the toilet.I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morningurinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over thetoilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and splittime precision but it\\'s the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowlduring the first morning pee.So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally toblame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroomcleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.It\\'s not our fault, it\\'s just Mother Nature.Now, if it was Father Nature, there wouldn\\'t have been a problem!!!',\n",

Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.Stack Manager ChangesTop of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader\\'s stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a \" Top of Stack Entry\" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.In order to turn on this functionality select the \" Allowed Top of Stack\" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the \"Allowed\"  option should be selected.Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader\\'s stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a \" Top of Stack Entry\" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.In order to turn on this functionality select the \" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack\" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the \"Allowed\"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the \"Restricted Top of Stack\" feature.Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the \" All\" option from the drop down box.Website ChangesNew Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box.Price of Limit OrdersModify Limit OrdersCustomers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the \"Today\\'s Orders\" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the \"Set\" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.Expiration time for Limit OrdersCustomers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.Float the Today\\'s Orders SectionYou can now float the \" Limit Order \" section. In order to do so, right click in the \"Today\\'s Orders \" section and select the float window option. In order to make the window \" Stay On Top \" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.Savita Puthigai<Embedded Paintbrush Picture>',\n",

The GTC will be an \\'internal only\\' GTC that we usethat tells any external customer that may inadvertantly access the internaltrade that the transaction is freserved for internal trading only; the onlyradio button will be a \"REJECT GTC\", which further prevents an externalcustomer from transacting.Stuart will post a Fixed Price price that represents the USD/CAD Exchangerate on Trade Date.

Let me know if you would like a formal opinionletter or if there is anything else I might do for you.  Later Joe202.466.9150\"Jeffrey Watkiss\" <dwatkiss@bracepatt.com>The $150 \"soft price\" cap that FERC adopted in its December 15 order appliesonly to sales of power into the California ISO market and California PXday-aheadand day-of markets.  These are the real-time and short-term markets,respectively.   By the terms of the December 15 order, the cap does not applyto any bilateral transactions, including sales to the California Dept. ofWater Resources (CDWR), which are generally for longer terms.Given the instability of the California market, the current applicability ofthe cap may change in the future.  In a recentlly released report, FERC staffrecommends that the cap be discontinued after April 2001 and replace by aseries of other measures to mitigate market power.  Thes include a marginalcost price cap on sales into the ISO by sellers who are party to theparticipating generator agreement.Although unlikely, it is not inconceivable that someone in the future mightargue that the role currently being performed by CDWR is in some respects thesame role as was formerly performed by the PX.  Based on that proposiiton, itmight be argued that a price cap similar to the \"soft price\" cap  be imposedon sales to the CDWR.',\n",

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.Thank you for your support.Enron Global Technology-----Original Message-----Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.

Paul does not have a blackberry or I wd sendthis msg to him.Thks christiem--------------------------Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld (www.BlackBerry.net)-----Original Message-----Hi Christie,I just received your response and tried calling to thank you for interviewing me yesterday. Your personal and prompt email is truly representative of Enron's ability to not only hire but also retain the best and the brightest. Up until today I have found no recruiter to bring out the problematic issues of a firm. The very fact that you put Enron's current problems on the table shows how strongly and genuinely you feel about the firm being secure and stable. I really appreciated you letting me defend Enron; it not only shows you my passion but also reiterates my genuine interest in the firm.I am writing to let you know that I had second rounds today as you know and in the first interview, which was supposed to be conducted by Jen Fraser but was conducted by Matt, a first year analyst, the concern was on GPA and academic performance rather that what value I can add or my keen interest in the firm. I was extremely shaken after this first interview; in the interview right after, Sarah, an associate, did manage to alleviate some of my concerns. However, I was wondering if this could possibly serve as a road block in the recruiting process as I really do not believe that my GPA is low or an accurate representation of my capabilities to perform on the job. I honestly feel that a 3.2 at Wharton equates to a much higher GPA at any other school in the United States.Although disheartened, I am extremely interested in Enron as a firm and am confident that if given the chance I will emerge as one of your most valued candidates. Thank you so very much.Sincerely,Aziz.\",\n",

       " 'Hi Folks,Trying to get this to you earlier as many people had asked for it sooner.Hope you have a great and joyful Thanksgiving.Here\\'s how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I alwaysreceive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on thecheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Justbecause one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn\\'tnecessarily mean I\\'d start the player with the best matchup.   PeytonManning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you\\'re sitting onKurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning\\'s your guy no matter who he\\'slining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool inyour box when it comes to deciding between players.weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mikemore info.   The points scored by position data is from our FootballguyClayton Gray.  Let\\'s get to it.Joe/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and ExploitOffense.Arizona Passing Game vs San Diego DefenseWe rated Plummer as a \"Lock\" matchup and he delivered with 334 yards and 4TDs.   If only they could play Detroit each week...  This week, they\\'ll facea San Diego team that ranks just # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game overthe last four weeks and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   WR DavidBoston is unstoppable and a must start.   Frank Sanders played well too lastweek but had what looked to be a pretty serious hamstring injury on the TDreception.   Check Plummer\\'s status as he has a bruised tailbone but I\\'dfeel good about him again this week.Atlanta Passing Game vs Carolina DefenseChris Chandler continued his up and down season with a nice outing last weekleading the Falcons to a huge upset over the Packers.   He threw for 352yards and 2 TDs.   Terance Mathis led the way with 7 receptions.   Mathissuffered a concussion but the early reports are that he\\'ll be able to go.This week, the Falcons face a soft Carolina defense that ranks # 21 inPassing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy PointsAllowed to WRs so this is looking pretty enticing.Chicago Passing Game vs Minnesota DefenseJim Miller to Marty Booker looked more like Montana to Rice Sunday.   Idon\\'t recall the last time I saw two consecutive bomb TDs to the same playerlike that Sunday.   Miller\\'s been up and down but clearly, Booker is a guyto watch.   Dez White and David Terrell are in the mix but this seems to beBooker\\'s show.   The Viking defense ranks # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed PerGame over the last four weeks so it looks like the Bears may be able tocontinue to roll.Green Bay Passing Game vs Detroit DefenseFavre isn\\'t as red hot as he was but he\\'s still a premier QB.   He threw for262 yards and 2 TDs last week.   He spread the ball pretty well betweenBilly Schroeder, Antonio Freeman and Corey Bradford.   Bradford had the bigyardage while Schroeder and Freeman scored.   All 3 are solid plays.   TEBubba Franks continues to be a non factor.   The Pack draw a great matchupthis week in Detroit that ranks # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game overthe last four weeks.   They rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs soyou have to like that.Minnesota Passing Game vs Chicago DefenseIf you\\'d been thinking about benching Daunte Culpepper, Randy Moss, or CrisCarter, you got your answer Monday night.   These guys should always be inyour lineup as they\\'re too explosive to sit against any matchup.   The Bearsrank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks soclearly, this is a must start for these guys.   The only downside to theMoss / Carter explosion was that TE Byron Chamberlain was left out of theparty.San Francisco Passing Game vs Indianapolis DefenseYou don\\'t need me to tell you to start Jeff Garcia.   He\\'s clearly one ofthe premier QBs in the game.   Terrell Owens is freaky good and is obviouslya must start.   J.J. Stokes had a breakout game last week so he deserves alook.   Tai Streets is not a bad reach and TE Eric Johnson is getting moreinvolved in the offense each week.   It\\'s sort of like St. Louis where anyof these guys are worth a gamble.   Indy ranks # 23 in Passing Yards AllowedPer Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 25 in Fantasy PointsAllowed to QBs and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so the 49ers arelooking good here./**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/stopping the Offense.Baltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville DefenseDoes anyone else find the Baltimore\\'s self destruction amusing?   The Grbactear thing on the sidelines (which looked like sweat to me) and then ShannonSharpe\\'s posturing as the self appointed spokesperson shouting aboutinterceptions was pretty funny.   Can Brian Billick hold it all together?Where\\'s Trent Dilfer when you need him?   Grbac will be fine I think.Sharpe is always a good play if you can stand having him on your team.Qadry Ismail and Travis Taylor are both decent options as they\\'re seeingplenty of action and TE Todd Heap even got a score.   Lots of weapons inthis passing game.   They\\'ll be facing a Jaguar defense that\\'s reeling andbeat up.   They rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the lastfour weeks.   Jacksonville ranks # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs forthe year.   All in all, a good matchup here.Detroit Passing Game vs Green Bay DefenseA perfect example of how sometimes the NFL does NOT mirror Fantasy.Charlie Batch is becoming a desirable QB simply because his team is so badand he\\'s forced to throw on every down.   Regardless of the reason, you haveto give this guy some credit as he\\'s clearly becoming more comfortable inthe system.   He threw an amazing 62 attempts last week for 436 yards and 3TDs.   I\\'ll take that.   WR Johnnie Morton led the way with 153 yards.   RBLamont Warren had 11 catches but his status is up in the air with the returnof James Stewart.   Green Bay is nothing special against the pass latelyranking # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.For the year, they are pretty tough on QBs though ranking # 8 in FantasyPoints Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle DefenseTrent Green had a week off to get everything together but you have to wonderhow much can be done in a week.   Derrick Alexander is supposedly ready toplay this week but you know how that goes.   I\\'d be leery until I see himplay some.   Snoop Minnis is still nursing an ankle injury and is iffy.   Asalways, TE Tony Gonzalez is the primary threat.   Seattle has been belowaverage lately ranking # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the lastfour weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBsand # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.New England Passing Game vs New Orleans DefenseCoach Bill Belichick raised some eyebrows when he announced Tom Brady wouldbe the starter until further notice.   Great news for Brady fans who\\'d beensweating a Bledsoe comeback.   Brady\\'s come back down to earth lately with amediocre 185 yard day last week but he\\'s still showing promise.   WR TroyBrown is by far the favored target and the only real receiver worthy of astart in most leagues.   New Orleans has been very vulnerable lately to thepass ranking # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last fourweeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.New Orleans Passing Game vs New England DefenseAaron Brooks once again offers some vindication for those (including us)who\\'d been sweating it after giving him lots of preseason hype.   2 passingTDs plus another TD rushing Sunday made his owners happy.   I\\'d go with thehot hand and keep him in your lineup.   Joe Horn is clearly the WR of choiceas Willie Jackson is up and down.   TE Boo Williams is not a bad reach ifyou need a guy there.   He caught 2 TDs and looked good doing it.   NewEngland ranks # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last fourweeks but be careful, as Bill Belichick seems to sometimes pull outsomething special to confuse young QBs.Oakland Passing Game vs New York Giants DefenseYou have to like Rich Gannon here against the Giant defense that was torchedby Minnesota last week.   Gannon threw for 311 yards and 4 TDs Sunday andlooks as in control of this offense as ever.   Jerry Rice looked half hisage running all over the field and played outstanding.   Tim Brown is asgood as ever.   This team has serious weapons and should go deep in theplayoffs, if not all the way.   The Giants rank # 15 in Passing YardsAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year they rank # 3 inFantasy Points Allowed to QBs.Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee DefenseKordell Stewart once again looked like a real NFL QB.   He threw for 266yards and a TD.   Most importantly, he didn\\'t fold up when Jerome Bettis washeld down.   Hines Ward caught 9 passes for 112 yards and a TD and looks tobe a good play most every week as he\\'s clearly the go to guy.   Tennesseeranks just # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.They rank # 26 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so theseSteelers could have a chance to do something through the air here.San Diego Passing Game vs Arizona DefenseDoug Flutie\\'s magic trick bag seems to be fairly well empty lately.   LosingTE Freddie Jones last week surely didn\\'t help even though Jones wasn\\'t beingthrown to as much as we\\'d like to see.   Curtis Conway and Jeff Grahamstruggled with Flutie.   This Arizona defense could be the ticket though asCharlie Batch discovered last week.   They rank # 17 in Passing YardsAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks but are playing softer than that.They rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy PointsAllowed to WRs.St. Louis Passing Game vs Tampa Bay DefenseKurt Warner\\'s a must start, obviously.   As are Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt.Both are outstanding.   Bruce had the big yards Sunday while Holt got theTD.   RB Marshall Faulk catches as many passes as the WRs, just anotherreason why he\\'s the best.   Tampa is limping but they rank # 9 in PassingYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They do have 13 sacksover the last 4 games so they\\'re obviously putting pressure on the QB./**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/Carolina Passing Game vs Atlanta DefenseAre you really down to starting Chris Weinke?   I didn\\'t think so.   MuhsinMuhammad could miss this week\\'s game with a shoulder injury.   That meansDonald Hayes would be the go to guy assuming his sore ribs allow him to go.TE Wesley Walls is always a threat although he seems to be less of the focuslately.   Maybe he needs to have another \"Keyshawn Fit\" and yell about notgetting the ball enough.   That worked pretty well for him last time.   TheFalcons rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeksbut for the year, rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   They rank #30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they\\'re definitely toastable.Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cleveland DefenseIt doesn\\'t appear to be the best thing for the Bengals, but Jon Kitnacontinues to air it out.   He threw 42 passes Sunday for 234 yards and 1 TD/ 2 Interceptions.   The Bengals have about 25 WRs it seems and all arepretty good.   Ron Dugans got into the act scoring a TD Sunday.   DarnayScott is the # 1 but it\\'s a crowded group there making it tough to pick outany one player.   The Brown defense ranks # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed PerGame over the last four weeks so you\\'d think Cincinnati would be able tothrow the ball.    For the year, Cleveland ranks # 5 in Fantasy PointsAllowed to QBs though so it\\'s not like it\\'s a cakewalk.Cleveland Passing Game vs Cincinnati DefenseTim Couch is winning the \"real\" NFL games even though he\\'s not doing muchfor your FF team lately.   His 144 yard / 0 TD / 3 Int game Sunday is anexample of that.   He\\'ll get back on track though.   Kevin Johnson andDennis Northcutt seem to be his primary guys with Quincy Morgan there too.Honestly, I wouldn\\'t count on too much from anyone but Johnson.   The Bengaldefense ranks # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last fourweeks so they\\'ve been tough lately.   For the year, they rank # 22 inFantasy Points Allowed to QBs.Indianapolis Passing Game vs San Francisco DefensePeyton Manning looked solid even with the broken jaw.   Jerome Pathon isgone for the year and Reggie Wayne\\'s knee is an issue.   It looks like it\\'llbe his old reliable target, Marvin Harrison.   Keep an eye on TE MarcusPollard as he could easily be the best receiver after Harrison.   SanFrancisco ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last fourweeks and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   You never know whenManning will throw that monster game though so it\\'s tough not to play him ifhe\\'s on your roster.Philadelphia Passing Game vs Washington DefenseDonovan McNabb didn\\'t wow anyone with his numbers Sunday but he didn\\'t needto in order to win the game.   He threw for 129 yards with 1 TD.   JamesThrash is still the go to guy with Todd Pinkston worth a roll of the dice inlarger leagues.   TE Chad Lewis was pretty active and caught a TD so youlike to see that.   The Redskins are starting to believe in themselves andnow rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.A dangerous game against the Redskins who have nothing to lose and can playwith abandon./**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/for the Offense.Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami DefenseAs a consistent Rob Johnson basher, Alex Van Pelt kept me from looking badby playing extremely well Sunday with 2 TDs and 316 yards.   And he actuallyfinished a game...   Clearly, he gives the Bills a boost.   Eric Moulds isstill the #1 WR but Peerless Price had a huge game with 138 yards and a TD.Larry Centers was also extremely involved and TE Jay Riemersma caught a TD.Miami is hurting without CB Sam Madison.   They rank # 6 in Passing YardsAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they\\'re still tough.Denver Passing Game vs Dallas DefenseBrian Griese just keeps losing weapons.   From Ed McCaffrey to TerrellDavis, now Rod Smith is limited with a bad ankle.   There\\'s only so much aQB can do without his weapons.   Smith is saying he\\'ll try to tough it outand play Thursday but it\\'s very questionable how effective he\\'ll be if heplays.   My friend (and Denver local) B.J. Miller says his guess is thatSmith will dress but likely not finish the game after re-aggravating theankle.  I\\'d agree with that prediction.   TE Desmond Clark needs to become abigger part of the passing game here.   The Cowboys are solid on defenseranking # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and #10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it\\'s a tough matchup here for theBroncos.New York Giants Passing Game vs Oakland DefenseKerry Collins threw for 321 yards but couldn\\'t find the endzone Mondaynight.   Ike Hilliard continues to improve and actually was more effectivethan Amani Toomer.  Tiki Barber remains a strong force in the passing gameand that should continue.   All 3 of these guys are solid starters.Oakland is very solid lately against the pass ranking # 4 in Passing YardsAllowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 inFantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City DefenseMatt Hasselbeck posted 134 yards and 1 TD Sunday.   With the way ShaunAlexander is running, that\\'s probably enough.   Koren Robinson and DarrelJackson are the primary targets but Hasselbeck is really spreading the ballaround.   Kansas City ranks # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over thelast four weeks although for the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy PointsAllowed to QBs.Tampa Bay Passing Game vs St. Louis DefenseBrad Johnson rolled up 399 yards Sunday without throwing a TD.   That\\'s hardto do.   Keyshawn Johnson remains TD-less which I admit is cruelly amusing.That\\'ll have to break soon though as he\\'s just catching too many passes notto score.   I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see him explode with a couple ofmultiple TD games as the odds even out.   Johnson to Johnson is really allthere is to talk about with this passing game.   The Rams are solid ranking# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For theyear, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.Washington Passing Game vs Philadelphia DefenseTony Banks left with a concussion Sunday but Kent Graham did a fine jobfilling in.   WR Michael Westbrook has shown nice maturity this seasonhanging in there and now looks to be the quality WR everyone has alwaysexpected him to be.   He had 9 receptions for 104 yards and a TD last week.The Eagle defense can be troublesome with all their blitzing so it\\'ll be achallenge.   Philadelphia ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game overthe last four weeks and for the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy PointsAllowed to QBs.   Should be a tough game./**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/problems for the Offense.Dallas Passing Game vs Denver DefenseRyan Leaf did little to impress anyone Sunday with a 102  yard / 0 TD / 2Interception game.   I can\\'t get excited about anyone on this offense.Joey Galloway could be worth a shot just for his home run potential but it\\'spretty bleak overall.   Denver ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Gameover the last four weeks and that doesn\\'t help any.Jacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore DefenseMark Brunell is looking very iffy again and it\\'ll likely be Jonathon Quinnagain.   (Has there ever been a good QB named Jonathon?)   That\\'s bad newsfor the Jaguar WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell although both playeddecent last week.   With Fred Taylor out again, Baltimore should have afield day.   The Ravens rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over thelast four weeks but for the year, rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.I\\'d shy away from these guys unless I had few options.Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo DefenseJay Fiedler looked lost last week throwing for 188 yards, 0 TDs and 3Interceptions.   He\\'ll have his up and down games but he seems to besettling back more toward the downside.   His WR corps is solid with JamesMcKnight, Oronde Gadsden and Chris Chambers but it\\'s hard to put a lot offaith in Fiedler.   I do like Chambers and his big play ability.   Buffalohas been tough lately ranking # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over thelast four weeks.   It\\'s actually not so much an issue of them being tough asit is teams just don\\'t need to throw to beat them.   Regardless, offenseshaven\\'t been putting up a lot of yards on them.   For the year, they rank #24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.Tennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defensebe healthy enough to play.   Guts it out through the game, rushing for moreyards than George, throwing for 172 yards and 1 TD.   It might win NFL gamesbut that probably won\\'t carry your FF team.   Derrick Mason and Kevin Dysonare both decent players at WR while TE Frank Wycheck remains his bestreceiver.   The Steelers bring a great defense though ranking # 2 in PassingYards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 2 in FantasyPoints Allowed to QBs not to mention the fact they\\'ve logged 18 sacks overthe last 4 games.   Tough matchup here./**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/Bryant Analytics, Inc.   All Rights Reserved 1999-2001cheatsheets-unsubscribe@egroups.com',\n",

Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play bett=er=20in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while==20for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing.

After the OSU game, I think the=20coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the=20hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season.

A \"Major\" Longhorn fan from Dallas=20=09=20constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing=20time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring=20everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.=20=09=09According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be==20allowed to =20=09=09compete  for the starting job. So far, that\\'s what\\'s happened. Now, whet=her=20Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he=20deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.=20=09=09It\\'s hard to argue with Applewhite\\'s results so far this season.

Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 25=7=20yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58.

I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he=20could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until h=e=20lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this=20offense. But it\\'s almost impossible to know.=20=09=09The players say it doesn\\'t matter who is playing QB, they\\'re both solid.=It=20is hard to argue that Major shouldn\\'t be the man. All he\\'s done is win and==20break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being \"the==20man\" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked==20onto a football field, he\\'s been Phil Simms\\' kid and the top choice to play==20QB. Now, he\\'s battling with a guy who has Major results.=20=09=09I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive=20coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for==20more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decide=d=20to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT\\'s offense throug=h=20three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has mor=e=20passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to=7=20in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in==202000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 =to=201 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.=20=09=09I tend to think Applewhite\\'s numbers would be much better if he were all=owed=20to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if h=e=20got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their=20production is down. Maybe it\\'s just a matter of getting used to this=20rotation. We\\'ll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about=20this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks a=ll=20season long. =20=09?=09=09defenses\\' tactics or Texas\\' own offensive scheme?  In other words, is the==20offense too complex so that they don\\'t know their assignments  or are they==20simply being outplayed? =20=09 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20=09ey=20have seen a slew of junk defenses through the first three games. Coach Mack==20Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive==20schemes that they had shown in previous games.=20=09=09Brown\\'s contention is that other teams can make their season by beating =UT,=20so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against==20Stanford, UT wasn\\'t good enough to make the Cardinal pay. So, according to =UT=20personnel, the defenses have been new.

To illustrate my point, Coach Brown became terse while=20citing fans as \"... being negative and openly critical ...\" (i.e., four=20losses in five games, 100 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB=20controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,==20Coach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites==20the team\\'s emotional psyche as \"... being fragile,\" yet Coach Brown fueled==20this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.==20=09=09Is it not the coach\\'s responsibility to provide stability to the team\\'s==20mental and emotional state? Is Coach Brown\\'s tenure paralleling the turbule=nt=20and volatile path taken by rival coach Jackie Sherrill at Texas A=02?(no eg=os in=20that one!) during the 1980s? =20=09?? David Newburn=20=09help=20his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very=20sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds==20them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone question=s=20the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negativ=e=20and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I==20honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light==20that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He==20forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That=20people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn\\'t. Or==20worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn\\'t (see==20Stanford).=20=09=09I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public==20appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the traditio=n=20to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his==20team. He wants fans to rally behind their team, no matter what, and be the==20first to pick up the team when it\\'s down. Not pile on.=20=09=09But people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks, get=s 10=20penalties and gives up another blocked punt for a TD. There is no question =he=20is still adjusting to the intense scrutiny that comes with being at Texas.==20When his team loses a game it shouldn\\'t and plays terribly in doing so, he==20will always hear it from the fans and the press, whether his team is young =or=20not.=20=09?=09=09ses=20this year? It seems to me doing so would open up the running game like it w=as=20when Ricky Williams was playing.=20=09?? Will Vernon=20=09e=20time to adjust. But I do think that with the athleticism of the young=20receivers, you will see more short routes that turn into long gains. Once R=oy=20Williams, Sloan Thomas and B.J. Johnson develop some comfort in this offens=e,=20I think you\\'ll see more long pass plays.=20=09?=09=09r.=20The first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting t=o=20have an experienced player returning punts in order to avoid mistakes, but==20why bring in so much talent and speed if you aren\\'t going to use it? Why do=es=20Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?=20=09=09He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in t=he=20kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but==20his average was more a product of Houston\\'s poor field position. We need a==20gamebreaker returning kicks. If you trust the freshmen to play significant==20minutes, why not trust them with the return game?=20=09=09Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?==20Hampton is a load and usually gets double-teamed. Why would you pull your==20All-American in a situation like that? In their nickel defense, shouldn\\'t==20they push Shaun Rogers outside and leave Hampton in the middle?=20=09?? Jeff Wilson=20=09n=20front of 80,000 people. That\\'s not the greatest criteria, in my opinion. I==20would like to see Nathan Vasher back there personally, just to see what he==20can do. Vasher has been fearless in everything I\\'ve seen him do. Mitchell==20hasn\\'t shown breakaway moves yet. If we don\\'t see it soon, it might be time==20to give someone else a shot.=20=09=09They take Hampton out on nickel situations because they think that Shaun==20Rogers is the better pass rusher from the tackle position.

       " 'As to your question about what\\'s going on in California, I\\'ve done somereading and here are my thoughts.The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commissionordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on theCommission\\'s authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that \"any rate,charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule,regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge orclassification\" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine thejust and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice,or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certainareas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but\"fixed\" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the Californiagovernor agrees with me that the Commission\\'s jurisdiction in the area ofwholesale electricity prices is questionable...In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigatethe justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, itsauthority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expresslyauthorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not justand reasonable.  \"Just and reasonable\" has been interpreted in many differentcontexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiatedrate deal, struck within a pipeline\\'s tariff authority, to be unjust andunreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entirecommunities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in theirelectricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageousacross the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW\\'stransport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user pricesand the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably notwidespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumerissue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I havealready discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice justabout everything and who might try to draw it to FERC\\'s attention.  We doneed to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing thesame types of deals.  Kathy, why don\\'t you and I discuss a system ofmonitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew,obviously I\\'ve only scratched the surface here so let\\'s talk if you want amore in-depth report.That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thingI\\'m remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related tomarket dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist onmarket power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, youbetter not use it.  DFSusan ScottI know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided becausethey are \"unconscionable.\"  There are several examples in consumer law andemployment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the otheris a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, noneof them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such asTW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargainsstruck at arms length.Kathy, I\\'d be happy to take the oars on this but if you\\'ve already done somelooking, please let me know if you\\'ve found anything.Stuck on the phone so I thought I\\'d email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran ifTW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under \"antigouging\" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can\\'tcharge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state lawwould probably be the best place to start)2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas pricesever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacksthe power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, itsnot a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gassellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If thathappens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 forMonday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan\\'s staff meeting (no written memonecessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need sto be done.  Thanks df',\n",

As it turned out I wasin the Enron building in London when it all happened on Sep 11. And to all ofus in London, that moment has been as defining as it has been to you in theStates.so that I have learned to tell the difference between the sounds of an IRAsemtex bomb and a Palestinian fertiliser one...And life goes on. I keep reminding everybody how many people die in the trafficevery day, and that I shall have to go someday anyway. So even though Londonprobably is high on the hit list, I have not changed my lifestyle significantly.Now it looks like EBS definitively is closing down in Europe. Personally iffind it a shame, since I rather valued the people in the group, but probably itwas inevitable.But I am pleased that you have moved into the Oil and Gas part of Enron.Whatever the current woes of Enron Corp, that sector is doing fine as a whole.My own stray into telecomms components did not last long. I was out after 3months on the back of completely collapsing sales in the US.Now I have ventured into Executive Search, where I am working as COO for asmall group with 70 staff in 10 countries. I am not \"hunting\" myself, butrather involved in corporate issues such as reporting contracts and businessdevelopment. We are hoping to place some Eastern European engineers into aHouston company before long, but I am not expecting to have to go there forsome time to come.You may notice that I am sending this e-mail from a new address.

       " \"---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 06/28/2000As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and thenabout CDS,the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largestprivately ownedmanufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosingitsfinances,so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annualrevenue andto the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in thebusiness ofmanufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and otherproducts.Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy thatemphasizes thelong term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-winsolutions withits suppliers, customers and partners.As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of itsexpensesgoes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history ofresearchingthose commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand(peopleeat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been verysuccessful,with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage inthese arenas.CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supportsthepurchasingfunction and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is amultidiscipline andmultinational team with a lot to offer.Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile basedonmanufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners inthisarea.Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party totalk to.In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing toanythingat this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest topursue the opportunitywe discussed in the future.I am looking forward to our video conference call.Kind regards,Avi---------------------------------------Avi I.

The $500k was negotiated in a meeting with George Fastuca andMark Courtney, where Mark agreed to share his profit.  We had worked veryclosely with them to assure the officer group, how this project compared todoing it with out ESC.  They never advised Dave Foti or myself of thischange.  The calculations for the up front payment was provided by them andclearly reflects the revenue sharing agreed to by Mark.Rod HayslettDid we have a contract that was written and spelled out?    If not, (prettysloppy business practice), then we are just going to have to tell Bill Cordesthat we didn\\'t have a deal, and someone is going to have to suck it in tomake up the $500K.    If we did, what does the deal say?David FotiCentilli/ET&S/Enron@ENRONIn rough terms, this is what I understand ECS\\' logic to be -The $3.35 per KW for transmission demand charge was assumed not to beavoidable and have a 5000 KW minimum when ET&S and ECS agreed on the $2.8MMone time payment.ECS says that they have negotiated to make the transmission demand chargeavoidable with no minimum.$3.35 * 10,000HP / 1.341 = $25k$25k discounted 10 years = $1.9MM25% of 1.9MM = approx. $500kOriginal one time payment = $2.8MM less $0.5MM = $2.3MM (the new payment ECSwants to give ET&S)ECS contends that Fastuca agreed to a 25% sharing of benefits received fromthe avoidable demand.  My recollection is that the 25% was used as abenchmark to estimate ECS\\' fee but was never established as a firm rule.ECS is supposed to provide us with their own written explanation for the$500k reduction.  They are also supposed to send us the \"re-negotiated\" rateschedule 21 that shows the transmission demand charge becoming avoidable.In any event, whether it is reasonable or not that ECS is due the $500k, itis reasonable to expect that ET&S would have been notified of this change ina more timely manner.Dave Fotix.31978',\n",

Recall that 3 weeks ago, the Court also granted TGS aninjunction against payment of the tax in Santa Cruz in the amount of US $17million which was unprecedented.Dodged another bullet!Cheers!Michelle',\n",

Commentsare appreciated.A few people met with FERC last Friday to discuss our general observationsand what a good RTO will look like (please see attached file below).Not all RTOs intend to file on October 15.  The filing RTOs (from what I canEntergy, (5) Southern Transco, (6) Grid South, and (7) Florida RTO.  (SPP andEntergy may file together)1. Immediate Public ResponseIt is critical to make sure that we have a list of key issues with each RTOfiling that we can use to make public statements.  Each RTO lead shouldprepare  preliminary list of issues and send to Joe Hartsoe and me no laterthan Friday.  When the RTO filing is made, we need to review this list andcompare to the actual filings and finalize.  This information will go intobuilding our public message.Our initial response will be public (through the trade press).  This willinclude making specific comments about each RTO.Right now we are focusing on (1) failed efforts and (2) insufficient work asthe key problems.  Any details or other topics should be considered.2. Formal Response to October 15 FilingDan Watkiss of B&P will be reviewing the formal filings for details.  JoeHartsoe will coordinate our FERC filings due on November 15.  We need thesedone by early November to run them through the commercial side.  Each RTOlead should schedule some time in DC the week of Oct 24 with Joe Hartsoe tomake sure that our filings are on-track and complete.We should file in each RTO case.3. E-trans ResponseJeff Brown continues to work to build our model.  No formal plan to roll thisout has been yet developed.  We are working to have something ready byDecember 1.4. Northeast Tight Pool ResponseI would like Steve Montovano to take the lead to structure our response.  Weheard at FERC that PJM was considering filing pretty soon (next week).

       " \"As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.Thank you.\",\n",

The delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the PUC operates.  It is also noted that there are many claims on SoCal\\'s and PG&E\\'s cash flows currently.  Additionally, agreeing to pay 15% of debts to the QFs raises legal issues, in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors, but not others.  This could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against SoCal by the non-QF creditors.',\n",

And cause for concern, too, because the European economyhad been one of the few bright spots this year.If there was any hope that the June earnings warning season would be animprovement over March, Sun just delivered a bold statement that it likelywill not be.So does this mean the Nasdaq goes back and retests its April lows? Maybenot just yet, but it\\'s beginning to appear likely at some point in theseasonally weak period of May-October.For now, investors are betting that the Fed will prevail in its crusade tokeep the economy from slipping into recession. And that\\'s not a bad bet tomake - the Fed has pulled out all the stops on this one. In addition tothe most aggressive course of rate-cutting in its 88-year history, the Fedhas removed the safeties on the other weapons in its arsenal. Justyesterday, the Fed added about $10 billion in reserves to the bankingsystem, the most since it added $11 billion on May 16, the day after itslast rate cut. Think the May 16 rally was a delayed reaction to the Fed\\'srate cut the day before? The word among traders is that it was theunexpectedly large addition of reserves via repurchase agreements on May16. The Fed was letting the market know it will pull out all the stops towin this one.But it\\'s a risky bet, and time is running out. Fed rate cuts take 6-9months to begin to hit the economy. The Fed began cutting rates on January3; that means they could begin to hit the economy as soon as July. Whichmeans that companies had better have something - anything - to say aboutvisibility on their July conference calls, and certainly by Cisco\\'s Augustconference call. Otherwise, this market may not continue to supportvaluations that are double the Nasdaq\\'s 15-year historical average.SparkLIST delivers high volume fast and reliable emailnewsletter outsourcing which allows you to focus on your~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For contact information on sales offices worldwide visit~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~For details on becoming a Commerce Partner, contact David Arganbright~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To learn about other free newsletters offered by internet.com or~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~internet.com\\'s network of more than 150 Web sites are organized into 16~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This newsletter is published by internet.com CorporationCopyright (c) 2001 INT Media Group, Incorporated.

As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and whiteissue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.  As executivesof this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible toensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with thisdivestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is intothe overall framework of ENA.I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the tradingfloor.I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gasbusiness.RegardsDelainey---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 01/10/2001Jim SchwiegerRedmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wes Colwell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT,Edward D Gottlob/HOU/ECT@ECTI\\'m very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since theHPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicatedto them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gasthat would be available on March 31, 2001.  The following is designed to setthe record straight in the spirit of \"Facts Are Friendly\".First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six -eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention ofWes Colwell,  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before yearend to discuss the unwind cost.  All parties indicated that it was not aproblem and that everyone was aware of the situation.  Now Im hearing just1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.2) reversing the April, 2007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31,2000.1)  The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCFwas made in 1992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.  This was based onthe fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the severalyears proceeding 1992.  Since 1992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice,the          latest  being March, 1996.  Throughout this entire period theAccounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and thephysical           capabilities of the facility.2)  The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do withanything.  When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it includedthe         reversal of all assumptions including the April, 2007 injection.This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.In         addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas leftin the ground.  If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then itcould be         reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up.It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow upirregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.  If I wasdealing with lower level employee\\'s I would agree, but given the levelinvolved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was ifI had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing thecushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicatedto and was aware of the situation.  Perhaps they were involved with otherissues related to the sell?  I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuringaround to cover their backside.',\n",

Crosses The Line5. Comment Welcomed---------------------------SPONSOR----------------------------Never Losing\" shows how to make BIG PROFITS without big risks.-----------------------------***------------------------------1. Overall SentimentThe popular averages traded higher in the first five daysof the market week for Jan. 7-11, confirming the so-calledJanuary Barometer that says that if the first five tradingdays are positive, then this bodes well for the remainderof the year.This doesn\\'t mean that the popular averages won\\'texperience one or two relatively serious stumbling blocksby the end of the last trading session of 2002.During the past five days, the Standard & Poor\\'s 600 SmallCap Index reached an all-time high, giving furtherconfirmation that small cap stocks will reward investors in2002.But what about the Big Cappers such as Microsoft, IBM, SunMicrosystems, Cisco Systems?In my view, I figure these companies won\\'t surprise WallStreet by announcing that they\\'ve entered into Chapter 11bankruptcy the way Enron and Exodus Communications did in2001.Of course, the speculators went after Enron and Exodusafter the bad news, figuring this is where we can make adouble, triple, much less God knows how rich we can get ifthese companies actually come back from the abyss.speculating in busted companies and forget about aneconomic recovery and all that such a concept implies, thenlet\\'s hope that more companies go bankrupt.In other words, you buy them at 0.035 a share and sell themat 0.07 a share and you\\'ve doubled your investment.Still, that\\'s a double, and who can argue with that?Speaking of doubles, a lot of beaten up Internet stocksfrom the 1998-2000 Era have doubled off the lows since the9/11 Attack on America.But will they be the 10-Baggers of 2002?2. ObservationsThe price for a gallon of regular gasoline remained thesupermarket.Despite the attempts of OPEC to create a bull market in oilfutures, the February contract for West Texas IntermediateCrude that trades at the New York Mercantile Exchange wentout at $19.68 a barrel on Friday, Jan. 11.On Friday, Jan. 4, the nearby contract closed at $21.62 abarrel.That meeting between President George W. Bush and RussianPremier Vladimir Putin last December is having its effectson the international crude oil markets.In my view, we\\'re still dependent on oil and natural gas tokeep the U.S. economy humming, much less the rest of theworld.3.

They do not see anything particularly wrong withit either - to them this is completely different to the Indian deals as theywere not involved with preparing the documentation, merely accepting it froma third party.  They see the car purchase (second hand Toyota) as a simplepayment mechanism rather than a bribe.The instructions that they gave to their team in October was to cease all ofthe Indian deals - they seem not to have applied an ethical motive to this,but more a specific dictate covering India.Doug Imrie is currently reviewing all other international deals and isworking through with Stephan Scheppler (the Manager of the Frankfurt office),what will and will not be acceptable going forward. A list of writteninstructions will be issued following this review.We do not believe that any action against Stephan Scheppler will help toachieve anything in terms of improvement in management going forward.  UnderGerman law it would probably be very difficult to prove that he has actedagainst instructions (indeed he does not seem to have received the rightinstructions).We do believe that to tighten the top management organisation would provide a1.  To nominate Matz Heil (previously Bergman) to lead the 4 personmanagement team (currently they are all equal and have individual approaches)2.  To have him reporting directly into Rob Soeldner in order to give thecommercial direction an Enron approach.Joe will take steps to implement this when he returns from NY at the end ofthis week.

Only 3 percent of flyers feel that they will \"nev=er\" be at ease with the air travel experience.   The study was designed by =J.D. Power and Associates and was conducted with Yahoo! Inc., a leading glo=bal Internet communications, commerce and media company. More than 2,200 ad=ults were surveyed about recent air travel experiences and future air trave=l intent.   \"Nearly one in five air travelers are still \\'undecided\\' about w=hether or not they will feel safe traveling on a commercial jet,\" said Mich=ael Taylor, director of travel services at J.D. Power and Associates. \"But =these are positive numbers considering that this survey was conducted less =than five weeks after the September 11 disasters. This report illustrates t=he faith consumers have that air travel will once again be considered safe.=\"   However, 72 percent of flyers feel that air travel \"has changed forever=.\" The survey went on to ask respondents their perceptions about current sa=fety procedures on aircraft and in airports as well as possible security me=asures that could be implemented.   An overwhelming 83 percent of flyers in=dicated that they did not mind a longer check-in process at airports, as lo=ng as it increased the safety and security of the traveler. More than one-h=alf of airline passengers are willing to pay \"a security tax\" on each ticke=t to provide increased security.   \"A lingering fear of air travel was the =most often cited reason for the public\\'s reduced travel habits,\" said Taylo=r. \"However, business travelers cited a slowing economy as another leading =reason for a slowdown in business travel. Leisure travelers listed \\'wanting=to stay closer to home\\' as another important factor.\"   Among current in-f=light security measures, respondents rated in-flight armed air marshals and=armor-reinforced cockpit doors as equally important. Arming cockpit crews =and a ban on silverware in the cabin were reported as much less helpful in =re-establishing consumer confidence in air travel.   At the airport, a sear=ch of all carry-on luggage would inspire the most confidence in travelers i=n addition to existing security measures at airports. The presence of armed=law enforcement officers at the airport ranked a close second. The ban on =cutlery at airport restaurants is not perceived to be very helpful, accordi=ng to survey respondents.   \"To increase public confidence in safety at the=airport, travelers believe that new technologies could be applied quite ef=fectively,\" said Taylor. \"High-technology X-ray and scanning, along with el=ectronic bomb-sniffing equipment, were cited most by respondents. These ite=ms were considered even more effective than Federal control of the airport =security process.\"   This public opinion poll was conducted among random vi=sitors to Yahoo\\'s Web site during the week of October 10.

       " \"To Principal Officers Energy Committee members, Liaison Representatives andIt has been about a year since we began working together to advocate for ahealthy energy policy and future for California employers, employees andtheir families.  We have been meeting weekly (at least).  It's been a greatchallenge to understand the issues, determine our principles, goals andobjectives, build key partnerships and learn to advocate effectively in adifficult and politicized environment.  We started out in the frying pan,skipped the fire and went straight into the furnace (via the crucible) andhave remained there to the present.   Our learning curve has been steep andbumpy at times.  Despite some frustrations and setbacks, I am happy to saythat there is much to celebrate and recognize as successes for SVMG.   Wehave been involved in many sectors--Conservation, Smart Load Management,advocacy for clean new generation and transmission, smart policy andcommunications in all these areas.   Below is a brief presentation I madeto the SVMG board of directors this past Wednesday presenting our return oninvestment and highlighting accomplishments for the dedicated efforts of somany great people and companies.  Feel free to respond.  We welcome yourinput and feedback.I wish to especially recognize the efforts of your energy committee leadersMares (formerly Sun, now Exodus).  They have represented you with skill,wisdom and more than a dash of panache.   In upcoming messages we will berecognizing other key leaders who serve you so ably.

There should be no combustible materialthere, and sooner or later a fire will result.  You are fortunate the resultwas not worse.  The important metal underlayment supplied with the fireplacewas not installed.  The fireplace must be moved about 5\" up to the face ofthe wall.  All the tile must be removed and replaced with non combustibleunderlayment.  The chimney seems ok but you must replace the cap and thechimney is no longer available, necessitating fireplace replacement if itever becomes necessary due to corrosion.  The insulation is probably wet,which happens over the years and it settles, leaving hot spots in thechimney.  At least yours is out in the air, but it should be checked, andwill be if I do this job.You will provide the tile, and bear in mind that some will have to be cut,so avoid small tiles.  You will also provide sanded grout and groutadditive, and a mastic (25#) such as epoxy \"Elastobon\".  Your tile supplierwill know what we\\'re talking about.  I will get all other materials locally.You are looking at, I estimate, $2,400.00 - $3,200.00 plus materials.  Iprefer to work jobs like this at Time and Materials, based on my labor rateof $50.00 per man hour.  If I have to bid this job, it will be suitablyinflated to deal with unforeseen variables.  I have been here for 26 yearswithout any construction related problems, and have lots of references.The materials will consist of cedar shingles, plywood, roofing shingles(asphalt), glue, Wonder Board tile underlayment, stainless steel cap, 2X4\\'s,screws, plumbing fittings for the gas line, sheet metal, and incidentals.My estimate is done as accurately as possible, but unforeseen problems couldchange the time I\\'ve estimated for the job.  The materials will be about$700.00, and this is the deposit I will require.  Let me know what the ETAof your tile will be.  If you prefer, I can do the job without the tile,leaving the Wonder Board tile underlayment exposed, which is totally safe,and you can decide upon tile later, after looking at the site after thefireplace is moved.  I will need a half square min. to do the roof of thefireplace pop out.Regards,Will Guyan',\n",

I continue to serve on theboard of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron\\'s corporate executive forthis year\\'s fundraising efforts.As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with themultiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannotimagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Takinginsulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development ofcomplications; insulin is simply their life support system and without itthey would die.Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDFis a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all moneyraised goes directly to research.  Enron\\'s goal this year is to raise$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need teamleaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for thewalk this year is \"Knock Out Diabetes\" and we would like to have you join usfor this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enronpeople participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or ifyou would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committeemembers listed below.

He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data andthat the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.  The only (butvery important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of100%, which does not imply a 100% of RAB multiple.  Rather, the initial RABmultiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken downby 20 percentile points.  Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closerto the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.  Please call Keithif he has not yet contact you.',\n",

You will like him andhe will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for acouple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverseengineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He hasothers on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about hisexisting AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaperalready).Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in thecould spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a goodoption because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), MarySolmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck(advice and discuss additional resources).I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quickthoughts on process and lessons learned.I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified earlyversions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on themarketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make surethat he understood the importance and priority of this effort.I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning JohnTollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Mondayafternoon.Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements toadd a trading perspective?A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.mike\",\n",

For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality.EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company.Performance-Based Ratemaking Conference, Dec. 6-7, 2001, Denver, COElectric Power Market Performance ConferenceDecember 12-14, 2001, Denver, COOVERVIEWEach year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the midwest.A second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for transmission expansion.Finally, the conference will highlight one of the important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.Power Market Design Workshop, Dec. 12, 2001, Denver, COElectric Power Market Performance Conference, Dec. 13-14, 2001, Denver, COElectric Risk Management 101 WorkshopAndPortfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities ConferenceJanuary 22-25, 2001, New York City, NYOVERVIEWIn the current environment of volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk.

The manual was developed jointly by researchers from Resources forthe Future, the Regional Environmental Center for Central and EasternEurope, and the New York University School of Law, as part of a projectfunded by the Global Environment Facility.Ruth Greenspan Bell | November 2001Corn CaseStarLink - a type of bioengineered corn that produces its own pesticide andwas approved only for animal feed - was found in the human food supply justover a year ago, prompting massive recalls of corn-based products.Resources for the Future, in cooperation with the Pew Initiative on Foodand Biotechnology, is in the process of identifying and analyzing theregulatory and public policy issues raised by the StarLink episode.Mike Taylor and Jody Tick | October 2001Few economic analyses examine land trusts, their decisions, and theland-trust \"industry,\" despite their growing importance. For example,statistics on the wide variation in the number of trusts in differentregions of the United States raise questions about whether such variationmakes economic sense. This paper builds a model to identify the optimalnumber of private conservation agents, and concluded that the number oftrusts is consistent with the optimal number of trusts that is predicted bythe model on the basis of the relative importance of spatial externalitiesand organizational size in different regions.Heidi J.

It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.

I have spoken with Norm and he asked that I send this out to forcomment.Please look at the bill and specifically Section 13, on Page 35 (see below).I believe that if this bill were to become law direct access in SCE's,PG&E's and SDG&E territories (I believe the section stands alone so itwouldn't matter if PG&E accepted the same deal or not) would be dead.  Insummary, the bill would essentially allow any IOU to go back into thegeneration business and require the CPUC to approve rates that aresufficient to cover their reasonable cost of operation, investment andprovide for a reasonable rate of return (I don't believe this is cost-basedrates).  The CPUC is given broad latitude over conducting proceedings,issuing orders or anything else that may be necessary to accomplish the goalof assuring that service provided by IOU's is adequate.  Section 13 willkill competition, eliminate direct access and create new stranded costs.And, to add insult to injury the State Power Authority may be their partnersin crime.As to the politics of the bill it was just amended to be a majority votebill.  Burton has said it is this bill or nothing.  SCE is opposing the billbut there are several lobbyist who think this is all an ambush and SCE wouldlove this bill.Please comment on my above analysis.

In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.

       " \"Tom says this deal was firm energy, but it is transmission contingent. WhenTom did the deal with FPL, he said he wouldn't buy it unless the energy wasfirm. The power has already been delivered, however, so Tom said it shouldn'tmatter what kind of energy the confirm has, so for the sake of getting itdone, he said just to agree with what they have in their confirmation. Doesthat make any sense? And the same goes for deal 516506.He is still disputing the price (where Enron shows $90 and FPL shows $95 indeal 517520), and he's expecting a call back from Jeff Wallace on that.Thanks,KateKate, could you ask Tom if this transaction is suppose to be Firm in Enpower.Their confirmation says Non-Firm, Transmission Contingent.

Under terms of the agreement, PNM and WesternResources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGEsubsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be nnamed at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination,Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, includingits 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, intoWestar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicatedequity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, includingconversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the newholding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing WesternResources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value ofapproximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a totalenterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9billion in debt and preferred stock).

Senator James Jeffordsannounced his defection from the Republican Party, but statedthat he would not disrupt President Bush\\'s tax package. Someinvestors had feared that Jeffords\\' defection would put the taxpackage at risk. Meanwhile, economic data pointed to furthererosion in the labor market and suggested that the bestconditions in the housing sector may be in the past.

The probability moved higher after theweaker-than-expected home sales data and thelarger-than-anticipated rise in weekly initial jobless claimsseen this morning.

This problem seems to be a\"type fault\" and along that line we have sounded out the Insurers and Medwaywhether they would be interested in taking a joint action against GE on thebasis that the GT\\'s GE has supplied are not fit for purpose. The response wasa resounding yes, with the insurers wanting to set up a meeting between theaffected parties. This was done on a confidential basis and I have not pulledthe trigger on setting this up. (Jim Boullion, the insurance contact wasDavid Way). Our legal advice is that it would be very difficult to take thiskind of action given the extent of the no consequentials language in thecontract, under NY law. However this point may be a reasonable Hammer over GEif they cut up rough and give us a bad deal. I think a joint action in themarket could severely affect GE\\'s sales position of the 9FA product range,whether we have a strong case or not. Gordon Grimes and the litigation teamare tasked with trying to find us an angle on which to sue.Medway got stiffed by GE with the cost of repairs and extended warranty,whereas we got these covered in our last deal.The insurance market dried up in the UK on the insurability of these rotorsFinal insurance costs rose 300% and their deductable went over 60 days (Oursis currently 14 days!

The rotor was replaced with their spare one. The second failure wasmore recent in July 2000, on CT1, when five of the R2 blade tips broke offand caused secondary damages to rows R11 and R13. In this case, though GEadvocated site repair of the rotor, the insurance company refused to acceptit. Medway had to send the rotor for refurbishment to the GE repair facilitybefore they could get reinsure this turbine.  The costs of repair were borneby Medway and; all warranties had run out.Both gas turbines had the old design of compressor blades. Subsequent to thefailure, robust compressor blades were installed in row 2-5 and 9-16 on bothcompressors.CT2 is running with the new compressor blades since December 99. A September2000 CI and boroscope inspection on this unit revealed minor burring of R0stage blades. CT1 is running with robust blades since October 2000.Though Tim Sharp was a bit circumspect on commercial questions, he didindicate that their insurance deductibles had gone over 60 days, with apremium increase of about 300% and  the insurance market dried up in UK andthey had to get about 20% of the cover from the US.Neil McGregor@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTpaul.kraske@enron.com, Ken Blades/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTRaman if you have not done this contact Medway immediately and swap notes.Find out if it is the same problem as ours and find out what they did with GEto resolve it commercially.

Please feel free tocall with any questions.San Marcos Pipeline Property (SVH has no information, inquire of Dan Hyvl,Anne Elizabeth White, Gerald Nemec or Sandi Braband)Allen Compressor Station (SVH is reviewing the current lease and filecontaining partnership agreement relative to this Oklahoma-based asset andwill contact Brandi regarding legal options available for disposing of thisasset)Enron Field Services / Nacadogches Gathering System (ENA sold its interest inthe Nacogdoches Gathering System portion of this combinationgathering/transmission pipeline system to Pinnacle Natural Gas Company inSeptember 1999 [the combined gathering/transmission system package had beenacquired from El Paso Field Services in January 1999.  Currently HPL owns theTrawick System which consists of approximately 35 miles of 8\" pipelinelocated in Nacogdoches County, Texas.  I believe this pipeline connects HPL\\'sTexoma system to Lone Star--are you certain that this is not being sold toAEP as part of the HPL system?Matagorda Terminal  HPL or one of its older subsidiaries (HPL Hydrocarbons,or something similar), owns a partnership interest in a general partnershipthat owns and operates this natural gas liquids or condensate barge terminallocated on the intercoastal waterway adjacent to the Oyster Lake CondensateStabilization Facility that HPL sold to TPC in 1996.  Steve Schneider (orperhaps Ann Elizabeth White) should have the partnership agreement.Robstown Flare (SVH has no information)Crawfish - Plant Sale  Crawfish - Land Sale  (SVH has no information--GeraldLofton, Jack Simunek, Shonnie Daniel,  or Sandi Braband might  have details)Texaco Purchase Assumption Parish (SVH has no information)Napoleonville Salt Dome  This item on your list, together with the next twoentries, comprise the gas storage facilities owned by Enron Storage Companyand I believe these assets were contributed to and are currently utilized bythe Bridgeline Joint Venture that was formed in 2000 with Texaco.  ShonnieDaniel, Barbara Gray and Sandi Braband are the lawyers who know the detailsof that transaction.Enron #1 Storage Well  I believe that this refers to the natural gas storagewell that Enron Storage Company has been leaching at the    NapoleonvilleSalt Dome.  (Garry Wilson would have details regarding status of completionof this well and the high pressure gas storage cavern that  is being leachedat such site; as stated above Shonnie Daniel, Barbara Gray  or Sandi Brabandshould know details as to what portion of this facility  belongs to theBridgeline Venture with Texaco.Dow Wells #13 &#4  These wells refer to the 2 gas storage caverns that EnronStorage Company leased from Dow Chemical under a Capacity   Lease transactionfor gas storage use until the Enron owned Storage Cavern that is/was beingleached at Napoleonville is completed.  As stated   above, Shonnie Daniel,Barbara Gray and/or Sandi Braband should be able to advise what contractualrights, if any, ENA retained upon entering into  the Bridgeline Transaction.Idled Meters  I am guessing that this refers to well connect meters that havenot been removed from non-producing gas wells, or to meters retired to HPL\\'swarehousing facilities.  Shawna Flynn is the lawyer most likely to haveinformation on this subject.Cain Bros.

       " 'Rod-This seems to be a reasonable approach although we have not done this before (so my experience base is a bit limited).  I assume the heavy involvement of CRM assures that we, collectively, are looking at this fairly and has the added benefit of assuring CRM\\'s buy-in if the outside price is cheaper.  I know that Wessex could do the analysis on their own, but I believe Jim and CRM should be involved to achieve the above benefits.Rod, I am happy with your sending this message out to the Wessex team, copying me on the email.What do you think of the following proposal to get this process off and running?   I would propose sending this to the 2 of you and Keith as well as Beverly Markham and Mark Watts.    It can come from me or from you?     Your choice.After the budget session last week, I thought I needed to make sure one more process is started and in order.     Insurance costs have risen and there is a \\tdisconnect between expectations and actual results.    I would like to think that we can develop the proper insurance program for Wessex and other Operating \\tCompanies in a short time.I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the request for quotes.   \\tThis is so that everyone is dealing with the same information.     I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the market and then give the group program \\ta right to match the deal.    I think the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed  and then follow that up with the information \\tto go out in the RFP.1.\\tThe OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing.  The Broker is subject to CRM\\'s (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services) \\tapproval.  Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.   An appeal of an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible.2.\\tCRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM,  the necessary underwriting information.3.\\tThe OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages,  limits, and deductibles they require for their business.4.\\tCRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to the competing brokers.5.\\tThe competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed.6.\\tCRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report the results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropriate senior \\tmanager within Enron.7.\\tOC will elect the program and price they  prefer and CRM will have the right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the placement of a \\tseparate program.8.\\tFor locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker becomes \\ta \"correspondent\" within the established Enron Broker Network.  This will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs.I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory conclusion in the process.     Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed program, \\tbecause obviously we need to get started ASAP.Rod HayslettEB4054713-853-6178',\n",

Last month, as gasprices plunged to a 10-month low, the plant switched back to gas.Florida Power & Light wasn't the only one. Many electricutilities in the U.S. are able to burn both fuels, and several aremaking the switch to gas, which is now cheaper than oil in someregions. Companies such as Detroit Edison Co. had been burning oilsince the winter.``It wasn't really until the early May timeframe, when gasand oil prices crossed paths and gas became cheaper,'' that theswitch was made, said Gary Lapplander, the company's manager offuel supply. Michigan's largest electric utility had been runningits 780-megawatt Greenwood plant near Port Huron on oil since lastDecember.Fears of winter shortages drove natural gas futures on theNew York Mercantile Exchange to a record $10.10 per millionBritish thermal units in late December, more than quadruple theyear-earlier price. This year, prices have fallen below $4, partlybecause last year's rally caused so many generators and industrialcustomers to seek alternate fuels, such as oil.Saving MoneyFuel can account for more than 90 percent of a power plant'soperating costs, according to some estimates.Mild weather across the U.S. this spring has reduced demandfor gas to heat homes and power air conditioners, while recorddrilling in the past year has led to higher gas flows from U.S.wells. Since late March, utilities have been pumping gas intounderground storage at almost three times last year's rate,according to American Gas Association figures.Fuel oil has a much different story. Prices for No. 6residual fuel oil -- the grade most commonly burned in powerplants -- are linked to crude oil prices, which have climbed 4percent this year.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has cutcrude oil production twice this year after raising it four timesin 2000. And refiners have been sopping up supplies in recentmonths to make gasoline for the summer driving season.Natural gas prices at Chicago's distribution hub fell belowfuel oil prices during the week ended May 18, the first time itwas cheaper in almost seven months, according to Bloombergfigures. Fuel oil prices in Chicago are little changed this year.``It's really a factor of economics,'' said Carol Clawson, aspokeswoman for Juno Beach, Florida-based FPL Group Inc., parentof Florida Power & Light, which can switch about a quarter of itspower plants between gas and oil on a few hours' notice. ``We aredetecting gas prices coming down, and as that occurs, we are goingback to gas.''Fear of a RallyTo be sure, some power-plant operators may be wary ofswitching back to gas because of the chances for a rally thissummer, said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus inNew York. As hot weather arrives, homeowners and businesses willturn up their air conditioners, pushing electricity use higher andlifting gas demand. Natural gas futures last summer rose 29percent.Adding to that demand, gas-fired power plants with about25,000 megawatts of capacity are expected to start up this summer,according to a U.S. Energy Department report published last month.Last year, about 22,000 megawatts of new gas plants started up,boosting total U.S. gas demand by 500 billion cubic feet, or 2.3percent. A megawatt is enough to light 1,000 homes.Other variables in the gas market include the extent of anyheat waves this summer, and whether hurricanes will enter the Gulfof Mexico, disrupting operations at offshore rigs that account fora quarter of U.S. production.``People don't fully trust gas,'' Evans said. ``They'rewondering if it's going to remain the cheaper fuel, or if it'sjust going to turn around and do to them what it did lastwinter.''Still CheaperOil is still cheaper than gas in some regions. In the NewYork City area, where utilities don't have to pay as much to getoil delivered from tanker terminals in New York harbor, heavy fueloil costs $3.89 per million Btu, compared with $3.99 for naturalgas, according to Bloomberg figures.Even so, the drop in gas prices has prompted Brooklyn, NewYork-based Keyspan Energy Corp. to increase gas's share of itstotal power generation to about 40 percent, said company spokesmanDavid Manning. That's up from about 3.5 percent at one point lastDecember.Normally, almost all of the company's plants would be burninggas at this time of year, Manning said. Keyspan produces power forabout 1.1 million customers on Long Island.``We're right on the cusp'' of gas prices falling low enoughto switch the remainder of the company's generation away from oil,he said. ``We would anticipate we will be running on gas even morethis summer, unless something dramatic happens with the weather.''--Bradley Keoun in the New York newsroom (212) 318-2310 or atbkeoun@bloomberg.net /wbprices in Chicago to wholesale natural gas prices at the ChicagoTo compare natural gas futures prices on the New York Mercantile{NG1 <Cmdty> CL1 <Cmdty> HS2 <GO>}.FPL US <Equity> CNKSE US <Equity> CNNI GASNI OILNI NRGNI RVUNI FEANI WINNI USNI NYNI FLNI ELCNI UTINI TOP_\",\n",

As expected, the Judge reiterated his disagreement with the PJM p=roposal and urged the Commission to take a \"go slower\" approach that includ=es a minimum 12 month up-front assessment of technology and \"best practices=\" determinations. =20Pat Wood first questioned why the Board makeup should consist of existing I=SO board members.  He acknowledged that the existing ISO board members have=experience but questioned whether the benefit of having their experience i=s outweighed by the possibility of continued parochial interests that may b=e retained by these board members.  He thinks perhaps the board should be m=ade up of totally new board members.  Ironically, in the mediation only a c=ouple of consumer advocate-types supported this type of approach.  Everyone=else believed that using the existin ISO board members makes more sense si=nce they all have experience.  We supported a board makeup weighted in favo=r of PJM so that implementation of the PJM system would be assured.  Pat se=ems to think this presents too much of a political problem.Pat also expressed concern that FERC not take action that would upset the e=xisting, functioning markets.  He said FERC should not force a result if it=does not know what the outcome will be and could disrupt the existing mark=ets.  He questioned whether they should take a different, slower approach i=n the northeast, perhaps putting some regional functions into place soon (e=.g., interregional transmission planning and expansion) and put off other i=ssues (a single real time balancing market) that may be harder to implement=at first.  Pat says that technology assessment is a big issue and can be a=show stopper if it is not done correctly.  Under the PJM proposal, the new=RTO would form by the end of the year and would start market design (based=on the PJM system) immediately.  Doing an upfront assesment could delay im=plementation significantly.  He said perhaps some things can be done sooner=than 18-24 months.  If he is thinking that long-term is 18-24 months, then=we could be okay because the PJM plan takes 24 months to implement.  But, =his statements on technical assessment are troubling and sound like he may =be willing to delay the startup of market design until this takes place.On the positive side, Nora Brownell reminded everyone that New York and PJM=have very similar systems but they have a lot of problems working together=and that these problems may be a hindrance to the developing retail market=s.

This is nothing new - the DTIhave been whinging about this for years (since EDF first arrived) butexperience has demonstrated that they have little scope to take action ifholding up European forays into the UK market.

Theonly legal option would be to invoke the reciprocity provisions of thedirective. However, given that part-loading of the interconnector is one ofthe reasons that prices have climbed under NETA, this would be a major owngoal for the DTI.We\\'ve also confirmed this with DTI officials following the Guardian report.The source was Dan Corry who is a \"special adviser\" - read spin doctor - tothe Secretary of State.

Politicaltarget is France. If State-owned, a provision could be based on the Spanishlegislation invoked to block control of Hidrocantabrico by EdF through EnBWand by EdP. The responsible UK official in DTI thinks that legislation isinvalid under EU treaty rules. Commission officials probably share the view.In any case such a provision would I think require UK parliamentary time toget through.

I believe this is something we want commercially, butwhat is not clear to me is how we envision this working commercially.  Inother words, although any swap can be bought out, I do not believe the ISDAdocumentation contemplates agreed terms for buy-out.  Rather, the partyseeking to get out early asks for the counterparty's offer and hits the offeror not.  If RBC or Swapco was not willing to make an we are willing totransact at, we might not be able to get out.

       " \"They should be entered with the price in only one strip, however, once they fix CARP, we may not need to worry about this.......I'll let you know.  Heather has a call in to the CARP IT people.-----Original Message-----So how should these deals be Enpowered in the future?  Cara has wisely warned me not to Enpower multiple strips to avoid this double counting.-----Original Message-----Mark, Tom, and Holden,The 2 deals listed below were put in as a MW month, each with 3 strips in the deal separating out April 1, April 2, and the rest of the month.  The reason for the 3 strips was to catch the April 1 time change from PST to PDT.Typically, I provide you with a report that tells you what $ amount to look for coming thru in your PMA's, according to the changes that I am making on the back end.  You then see the change in DPR come thru on a PMA report that Risk provides for you.When these deals hit Settlements, we recognized that the CARP was calculating both deals at 3 times their monthly value (and since we are purchasing, that is a negative three times against your books).  When the above + DPR impacts didn't come thru in your PMA's, we started looking at the deals to figure out why they didn't.Risk values a deal on the day of liquidation.  Any intra-month changes, even if they happen after the day of flow, get trued up by Risk and changed in the DPR.  Anything that gets changed after the end of the month, Settlements recognizes as a DPR variance and reports this to Risk and you see it affect your DPR as reported in the PMA report.Houston Settlements looked into it and were seeing that these deals were originally valued at ($66,500) and ($65,400), even though CARP was showing that they were calculating at ($199,500) and ($196,200) ....We found that CARP is reading these incorrectly and causing the confusion, (as I was seeing that the deals were calculating 3 times because that is how CARP and UNIFY were reading the deal).The IT people in Houston are now working on fixing that glitch.When it comes to DPR, your book originally recognized an impact of (66,500) and (65,400), which is correct.  Since your April DPR was correct, you will not see an adjustment in your PMA's.I recognize that this is not gratification for the + DPR impact that you were expecting and I apologize for the confusion and mis-information that I gave you in my report.  This has, however, helped us to hi-light a technical error that will save us alot of work in the future.Thanks for your patience while we figured this out.Let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,Virginia\",\n",

Ellen Wolf (of TaborsCaramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentationsby Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we madeThere isn\\'t much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not inthe wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that wouldhurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the Westas well.High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission doesanything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercisedby any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while stillincenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent levelequal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused byscarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load,therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real timeprices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fundas an asset allocation scheme.The market would function better if more information was provided to themarket.The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do,you will find there are many \"hidden\" slides that were not part of the oralpresentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additionalinformation.According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alotmore out of this meeting than Staff\\'s previous meetings with the IOUs and thegenerators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I\\'ve been getting, the Staffis looking into the data we provided.I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent toScott Miller on Friday.  Tim\\'s version conveys the same message but takes adifferent approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scottand answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor ofeliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to beable to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence ofscarcity .',\n",

It has a Democratic governor, two liberal Democraticsenators, and both houses of its legislature are firmly in Democratic hands.Not for nothing is it called the Left Coast.Then why, Californians now ask themselves, is their state the most troubledin the nation? Bad enough that Hollywood's writers are preparing to strike;worse that speculators in Silicon Valley start-ups are watching their stackof chips dwindle; worst of all is the unforeseen electricity shock that ismaking the state's hair stand on end.The price of electricity is soaring, yet the big electric utilities arethreatened by bankruptcy. Who's to blame?to work, cry liberal voices, those heartless capitalists drove up prices.Bring back the cool, calm days of inefficient monopolies under governmentcontrol.But in fact, the first villain is botched deregulation -- not as bad as inRussia, but 'tis enough, 'twill do.wholesale prices were freed from controls, but retail prices were not.Consumers remained seemingly protected, but the utility companies -- whichfoolishly thought wholesale prices would go down forever -- were enabled tobuy on the spot market. Legislators believing they were protecting consumersforbade long-term contracts, which are hedges against sudden pricefluctuations.This halfway dereg ran smack into the inexorable law of supply and demand.The good times of the 90's sharply increased demand for electric power. Butall sorts of obstacles were put in the way of increasing the supply of thatpower.broke, government intervention that frightens off private investment, and thedanger of an economic Big One in the state responsible for 13 percent of thenation's product.The unspoken issue in this bastion of liberalism is ''nimby'' -- the realvillain in the current supply crisis, that says ''not in my backyard'' topower plants. In San Jose, epicenter of the computer industry's drain onelectric power, New Economy voters recently rejected a new power facilitythat offended their aesthetic sensibilities. Red tape and purple rhetoric arethe reasons no major power station has been built in California in 10 years.Contrary to popular belief, electricity does not come from the socket in thewall. The steady flow of low-cost power comes from factories that convertenergy from other sources into the stuff that makes toasters pop,air-conditioners wheeze and computers beep. Unless energy is dug up andproduced in real places and transmitted through real lines, nothing comes outof the wall.Environmentalists recoil in horror at suggestions of nuclear power, now asafe and clean source of electricity, or the use of cleaned-up coal to lowerthe price of natural gas that generates it. Reducing pollution sensibly islaudable, but clean-air extremists become local heroes without tellingconstituents the danger of loss of Intel jobs and cheap electricity'shousehold convenience.The answer is not re-regulation, nor more halfwayism, nor federal bailout.When Gov. Gray Davis of California raced to Washington, D.C., to ask forwholesale price controls, he found Bill Clinton too busy carving up Jerusalemto mediate; Clinton-appointed federal energy bureaucrats offer onlypalliatives, with photo op to follow.Davis's panicked proposal to build state-owned plants (in Nevada? On themoon?) and his threat to seize the assets of ''price gougers'' may pleasesome new breed of dot-communists. But such populist pap destroys privateincentive to invest and is hardly the path for a presidential hopefulprofessing to be a centrist.After short-term action to alleviate hardship caused by past and presentpolitical-industrial blindness, our biggest state should avoid regressinginto more stultifying regulation and instead get out of the way ofstimulating supply.Why do I sound like a reformed drunk on this? Because I wrote the Nixonspeech imposing wage and price controls. They never work in peacetime. Never.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\",\n",

Do you want  meto make \\'noise\\' tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter?Until then, I wanted to discuss with you an idea  that Les and I have beenthrowing around concerning writing a series of articles  for Risk\\'s \\'EnergyandPower Risk Management\\'. We would like to propose to  them?that we would writeanarticle a month, covering practical issues  dealing with energy modelling andenergy derivative pricing and risk management.  The articles would be baseduponsections of the book so as to promote the book,  and to reduce the effort/timeinvolved by using?already produced material.  We would like to cover some verypractical topics, but we?won\\'t be giving  too much away as the articles areonly1 or 2 pages long.Each article would be of?the  form;- introduce?the concept- give an example using real data- discuss the problem with a case study- provide a discussion- sum upI\\'ve included a list of potential articles at the  end of this e-mail. Forexample, for the first one,  \"Estimation of mean reversion in spot energyprices\", we would introduce  the concept of mean reversion,?show a graph of anequity index and an  energy price?for illustration of our point, estimate theparameter for a  series of energies over a number of seasons, and finally,discuss the  results.We?are wondering if you would like to be  involved in this project? Yourinvolvement needn\\'t take much time (although it  is up to you). The kind ofinput we are hoping for (again, this is up to you) is  that you?would?reviewthelist of articles and  provide?suggestions of additions or deletions, suggestreasonable data sets  or case studies to work with on each article, and thentorun your eye over  \"near finished\" articles, which?we would supply to you foryour?practical experience?input.?

Last year your support helped Enron raise $2.8 million, which was 21 percent more than our original goal.This year, we hope to reach our employee goal of $2.9 million.  Enron will match every employee's contribution dollar-for-dollar.  We ask that employees who gave last year consider increasing their pledge this year, and that those who did not give, consider making a modest donation.The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers.  We will also be focusing on our United Way Scholars program, an innovative program created this year by Enron and the United Way.  The Scholars program builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.ON-LINE PLEDGINGDAYS OF CARINGAPPRECIATION LUNCHThank you for your generosity.

I believe that this is thetotal number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning totalk with Lee at GE.I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  Theyare working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks ofsigning the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He isworking with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has notyet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to theLLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stayconsistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda isGary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payableto ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchaseprice will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similarto Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricinginformation that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work forPanda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we arere-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use atLV Co-Gen?let you know when I hear back from him.FredKay Mann@ENRONCarnahan/NA/Enron@EnronFred,Dale Rasmussen has been handling the breakout contracts for the LV CoGenproject, and I think the form is in good shape. However, the breakoutcontract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. DoesGE know this is coming?What are you projecting for a closing date?We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates,price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell theLLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract.Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much?If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house.  Wehave the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel.  In fact,I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with theother deal.  Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'msure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest.

This they cannot do.  California has a substantial investment inunits located in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.  The lights would goout in California if they opened the ties.  In the 1970\\'s there was a hue andcry over loop flow, with California claiming that it was being injured byothers, particularly by the interior systems trading practices, however theynever considered opening the ties, because the benefits of interconnectionwere so large that the \"cost\" of loop flow was far exceeded by the value ofregional trade, i.e., they are economically interdependent.If such a foolish thing were done and California full \"closed its doors\" byopening its ties, cost would go up in the Northwest, in California and allthe rest of the Western System.  There are \"gains for trade\" which accrue toall parties from interconnection.  The trade is more complicated than justsummer/winter peaks (seasonal load diversity) there is also seasonal resourcediversity (Spring run off effects) and finally there opportunity tocapitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations.  I will address thelast point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns.The interior west (Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico) has largeamount of base load coal plants.  As load drops off in those areas, theenergy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro.The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill whichcan be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California.  This can beseen in the attached file, which contains a set of plots for hourly flow onthe Pacific DC Intertie Jun97, Dec 97, Jun 98, Dec 98, Jun 99, Dec 99,Jun00.  In these plots the clear day/night exchange of energy can be seen,especially in the Jun00 plot when sales are being made to California in theday and to the Northwest at night.  This day to night storage exchangebenefits lowers costs for everyone.On top of this daily/weekly cycle, there is the seasonal shift in loaddiversity you noted.  For the Northwest, its peak load occurs when energyproduction is the lowest -- during the winter.  As a stand alone system, thePacific Northwest (i.e., the Columbia Drainage area) is energy constrained.The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs.There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak, but not enough tototal water flow.  Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana (e.g. Colstrip andBridger) are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annualenergy requirement.  With these energy inputs from the coal fields, theseasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydrosystem, although fish, navigation, irrigation, etc. impose an increasingnumber of constraints.  Energy imports from in the winter from the South helpto meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved untilthe snow pack is better know in early Spring.  Some of the sales to theNorthwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement fromDesert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Intertiesto the Northwest.Finally, the Spring run off/fish flush when production on the river is at amaximum and load in the Northwest is down.  The sale of these surpluses paidfor the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system.Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been plannedto take advantage of this factor.  Again both California and the Northwestbenefit from this trade.In all cases, the parties would be worse off if the ties were open andeveryone was on their own.  The Northwest may be capacity long, but it istypically energy short, even in flush hydro years.  The winter energy importsfrom the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to theSouth lower energy costs in California.  California cannot craft a solosolution that ignores the rest of the West.  It is probably hard to decidewho would be worst off if California \"closed its doors\".  It is only clearthat total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West fromwhich it divorced itself.I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise.SteveJeff Dasovich@ENRONWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, RichardShapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECTTo Jim\\'s last point.  I understand that the good \\'ol utility system was oftenoperated with little regard for basic economic principles, but there\\'ssomething in this that seems very odd and difficult to assess, and it seemsto always be tied to this notion that \"California is a net importer, even inthe winter.\"  I\\'m going to start with the economics and then let folksdescribe why it seemingly doesn\\'t apply in Western electricity markets.If California closes it\\'s doors the other Western states will pay higherprices for power and/or face increased threats to reliability.  I\\'mstruggling to try to determine why these basic principles aren\\'t applicableto Western power markets.  I understand that the PNW is a very complex placeand that the reasons could be embedded in the arcane structure that hasdeveloped over the years.To keep it simple (though not necessarily accurate), I\\'ve confined theanalysis to a world in which only the PNW and California exist.summer.1)  The West, less California, is so awash in electricity that even in itspeak--the Winter--it still has power to send to California, i.e., it has sooverbuilt it\\'s system that it has persistent surpluses to sell to California.Irrespective, there have (to my limited knowledge) always been sales from CAto the PNW during the winter, when the PNW is peaking.The only conclusion that one can make, assuming that the PNW is awash inelectricity, is that the PNW takes the power in California because it makeseconomic sense to do so. That is, during the winter peaking months, it mustbe cheaper on the margin for the PNW to buy from California rather thanproduce itself.  Otherwise, it\\'s difficult to understand why it would buyfrom California during this month, particularly if they\\'re long.  As such, ata minimum, the PNW\\'s electric bill will necessarily increase if Californiacloses its doors.2) Neither the PNW , nor California, has indigenous capacity to meet peakingload.  Therefore, the PNW must buy California\\'s power during its peakingsummer period, and California must buy power during it\\'s summer peakingperiod.  In this case, not only will the PNW\\'s bill go up if Californiacloses its doors, the lights are likely to go because they\\'ll be short power.I realize that this is a simplistic model, and that there could be otherlegitimate economic factors driving the flows out of California to the PNW(e.g., transmission costs).  And again, I also realize that economics may nothave traditionally been a driver in the industry.  But I thought it might beuseful to get a common framework in place as a starting point for thequestion that Jim asks.With that, I\\'ll pose the question (understanding the simplicity of the modelis long---how can California closing it doors not increase the PNW\\'s cost ofpower?Best,JeffJames D SteffesWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@EnronIt seems to me that this information leads one to conclude that the value ofan open transmission network is that California does not have to build 5,000MW of power plant (4,500 MW max input + 10%) in state.  In other words, ifCalifornia were to disconnect from the grid, someone would have to buildadditional power plants in-state.The cost to California consumers is therefore the annual carrying cost of 10500 MW plants (made even more expensive after California expropriates thecurrent fleet of merchant generation).From the perspective of the remainder of the West, the question still remains- if California does go it alone, what is the economic impact?  Other thanlegal arguments about Interstate Commerce, why should the Federal Governmentwant to continue to pursue open acess?  This is the hard question that weneed to answer.JimAlan Comnes@ECTHain/HOU/ECT@ECTJim asked me in a voice mail what would be the cost to California of movingfrom the current (evolving) system of open access to a \"protectionist\"environment where access to the grid would be determined by a political bodyresponding to populist pressures.Here are some things to consider.  We can talk more and I welcome Sue Mara orCalifornia is a net importer so any restraint of trade would risk the statebeing able to meet its own demand.  See attached slides that show PNW-CAtrade.  Even in the winter, power on a net basis flows south.Limiting open access would primarily act to hold in-state generators hostage.this will kill incentives for new investmentIf the ISO\\'s proposal for market power mitigation are any guide of where ain-state generators would be required to sell forward or lose their marketbased rate certificatesload serving entities would be required to contract forward for load and areserve margin.reliability rather than more efficient market     outcomesArtifical notions of \"just and reasonable\" rates (on top of unreasonablereserve requirements) would lead to severe   reliability problems.  (In otherwords, if Steve Peace has his way, the imports into the state will dropoff     signficanly)There is no reason the state would be more effective at expanding the grid(e.g., Path 15) than the current system.  (Although, admittedly the currentsystem has flaws.  The CAISO was set up with little thought to transmissionexpansion planning.  Other RTOs are not repeating this mistake.).',\n",

The most significant cooling was expected in the Northwest, whereheating demand was forecast to climb to above-normal levels by week\\'s end.\"They\\'ve got plenty of hydro in the Northwest and that\\'s what limited theupside, but that also means there\\'s less power available from the north, soour prices went up a little as well,\" said one Southern California utilitytrader.  Many players anticipated more strength on Wednesday as the colderweather draws closer, but most expected the upside to be limited due to theabundant hydropower and relatively soft spot gas prices.  In other industrynews, Weil Gotshal & Manges, the lead law firm for bankrupt Enron, reportedTuesday that multiple bids had been filed for a controlling stake in EnronCorp.\\'s energy trading business.  Weil plans to announce the winning bidderat its New York offices Thursday, and then present the offer to the U.S.bankruptcy court in New York for approval on Friday.  Meanwhile, the courtis hearing arguments from creditors on why the case should be transferred toTexas.  While the bids and the bidders were to remain confidential, it wasreported that Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg were among the suitors, though athird financial institution that had previously expressed interest, J.P.Morgan Chase & Co., declined to submit a bid by Monday\\'s night\\'s deadline.British company BP Plc. also said it may be interested in the operations,and had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron\\'sassets, including some back office functions and some IT assets.  Enron\\'slawyers have stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, butrather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent.Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by an average of 1$/MWh forWednesday delivery.  Cooler weather forecasts were near-universally blamedfor the rising dailies, though most players conceded that healthy riverflows would limit the upside.  \"The colder weather is a small blessing forsellers, but also for the region as a whole.  The recent warm weather hascaused some snowmelt, something few people want to see until the spring, andthe lower temperatures should put a stop to that,\" said one Northwesttrader.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region wasexpected to average 64 percent of normal Wednesday, and then rise to a peakof 120 percent of normal by Sunday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph werelittle changed from a day ago, coming in at 85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfsSaturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and back up to 85 kcfs next Monday and Tuesday.Despite lackluster trading and continued mild weather, day-ahead electricityprices enjoyed a tempered upturn in California on Tuesday.  Gains weremodest, on the order of a dollar everywhere.  Traders cited coldertemperatures on the horizon and an incremental upswing in Western spot gasprices as the main factors leading prices higher.  \"Balance of the month istrading at a premium to the dailies, which is usually a sign of comingstrength,\" said one trader.  Peak goods at NP15 were bought and sold between22.25 and 23.75$/MWh, while the off-peak products changed hands from 16.5 to18$/MWh.  In political news, the FERC judge for the California refund casesaid he will hold evidentiary hearings through July 12, and submit hisproposal to FERC by early August.  The state accuses energy companies ofovercharging during last year\\'s energy crisis, an allegation the companiesdeny.  On a less litigious note, last month FERC asked the CAISO to come upwith a detailed plan for reforming the state\\'s energy market.  The proposalcould be unveiled as early as late Tuesday, and would include elements ofthe much-admired PJM RTO.  It would also emphasize a way to reduceintra-zonal congestion and include a plan for a day-ahead market, althoughon a smaller scale then the former one run by the CalPX.  There were nodramatic changes in the generation landscape on Tuesday.  Moss Landing #6(739 MW) and Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to the grid, while hydro unit BigCreek Project (1,020 MW) was operating at 970 MW.  On the weather front,Wednesday forecasts predicted high temperatures in the mid-50s and low-60sat mid-state load centers, and in the high-60s in the south.  Little changewas expected in temperatures through Saturday.  The most current six-to-tencalled for below-normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.Heavy load energy costs in the Southwest rose by an average of less than adollar on Tuesday, with the modicum of strength chalked up to rising spotgas prices and cooler temperatures on the horizon.  Peak power at Palo Verderanged from 20 to 22$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions seen right in themiddle at 21$/MWh.  Balance-of-January contracts were heard trading at abouta $2/MWh premium to the dailies on Tuesday, likely in reaction to the coolerforecasts.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (365 MW) was in the process ofrestarting Tuesday afternoon, as expected.  Four Corners #5 (750 MW) wasoperating at 550 MW Tuesday due to air-preheater problems, with no availableETR to full.  Weather Derivatives forecast heating demand in the desertregion to climb from its current level of 50 percent of normal, to justabove normal over the coming weekend, but the latest six-to-ten was stillcalling for a mix of normal and above-normal temperatures from January 14through 18.Patrick O\\'Neill and Jessie Norris_________________________________________________________Western Generating Unit OutagesCurrent                            Begins          Ends          ReasonCAISO units <250/6594 total          NA             NAplanned/unplanned*Alamitos #3/320/gas               04-Dec-01         ?            plannedAlamitos #4/320/gas               04-Jan-02         ?            plannedCoronado #1/365/coal              22-Dec-01     08-Jan-02    maintransformerEtiwanda #3/320/gas               22-Dec-01         ?            plannedGrand Coulee #19/600/hydro        10-Dec-01       March          repairsHaynes #6/341/gas                 07-Jan-02         ?            plannedHelms PGP #2/407/hydro            01-Oct-01         ?            plannedHyatt/Thermalito/933/hydro        02-Oct-01         ?      @607 MW,unplannedMorro Bay #3/337/gas              04-Jan-02         ?            plannedMoss Landing #7/739               29-Dec-01         ?            plannedOrmond Beach #1/725/gas           28-Dec-01         ?            plannedOrmond Beach #2/750/gas           05-Oct-01         ?      @350 MW,unplannedPittsburg #6/317/gas              22-Nov-01         ?            plannedPittsburg #7/682/gas              03-Jan-02         ?            unplannedRedondo #8/480/gas                09-Dec-01         ?            plannedFor unit owners refer to pdf version.*Indicates a change from previous EMR.______________________________________________________________________Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)January 8, 2002 for January 9, 2002Peak (Heavy) in $/MWhLow     Change   High      ChangeInto Cinergy    19.55    -0.95    21.25     -0.75Western PJM     24.25    -1.25    24.85     -1.40Into Entergy    19.00     0.00    20.00     -5.00Into TVA        20.25    -0.75    21.50      0.00___________________________________________________________Amid forecasts for warmer weather on Wednesday and little else changed inmarket fundamentals, heavy load energy costs drifted lower across theEastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  \"The EIA revised the Q1 electricity demandestimate downwards today.

       " \"Your assessment makes perfect sense to me.  What do you think about havingNels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is, what hemight look for when his current assignment is over, etc.  (obviously withoutidentifying us -- presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway inthe normal course of business)?  I am not wedded to the idea but am inclinedtoward at least getting the information, unless you see a problem.Linda RobertsonI got your message about Andrew.  He would be an excellent catch.  However, Isee a couple of significant problems.  My guess is that Andrew is too seniorfor this position, particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force.Also, I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months,if then.  We should fill this position immediately.  We are already missingopportunities because this position is vacant.As for our search, using Korn Ferry, I have narrowed the field to two verygood candidates.   I am setting up time for Rick to interview thesecandidates next Monday.  The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. TomDelay's office.  Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republicanleadership circles, seems trustworthy, and capable of learning most of thesubstance of the energy portfolio.  Drew has strong networking skills, whichI think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills.  Thesecond candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years.  Johnwas the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committeeunder Norm Lent.  John left the Committee in 1992.  Since then John hasworked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhancedhis political and Republican networking skills.  John in very short orderwould have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away fromthe industry for eight years.  I believe both candidates bring different butvery strong talents to the job.  I have a second opening for an enviromentaladvocate.  I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we couldredirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot.   That said,please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.\",\n",

These two sectors are expected to account fornearly 80 percent of growth in gas consumption between 1998 and 2015. (GRIprojects the nation\\'s gas demand will increase 50 percent, from 21.3 Tcf in1998 to 32.8 Tcf in 2015.)The added storage capacity will require a gas industry investment of nearly$5.0 billion (1998 dollars) between 1998 and 2015, or about $270 millionper year, the study estimates.The study, conducted for GRI by Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc.,Arlington, Va., identifies several trends that will drive future storage* High consumption by power generation and industrial markets dampensseasonal volatility. Since these sectors have relatively flatyear-round load profiles, they act to compliment rather thanstimulate short term demand swings in traditional residential andcommercial applications which drive the need for increased storagecapacity to overcome seasonal differences.* Increases in the value of market-area storage to accommodate significantgrowth in gas usage for power generation are anticipated. Due toimprovements in technology, favorable economics, and low emissions,natural gas is expected to be the preferred incremental fuel forpower generation for the foreseeable future.* Pipeline restructuring is changing the role and value of storage. Mostnotable are the development of secondary markets for storage andpipeline capacity, growth of market hubs and gas marketers, and a shifttoward market-based rates.* Storage services are likely to become more efficient as a result oflocal distribution company restructuring. Storage operators areexpected to have a direct profit motive to maximize the value of storageand are likely to offer new services that use existing facilities moreeffectively.\"These trends are already beginning to have a major impact on gas storageoperations and will only be magnified in the future,\" said John Cochener,GRI project manager and principal analyst-resource evaluation. \"We arealready seeing increases in the value of well-placed storage facilities,particularly those able to capitalize on regulatory changes that allow forgreater operating flexibility. The reduction in regulatory constraints willallow storage market players even greater latitude in the future toexperiment with innovative competitive tools. This will result in greaterflexibility in the timely movements of gas to where it\\'s required.Conversely, high-cost storage operators, who fail to respond to thechanging market by offering more flexibility, may eventually findthemselves at a competitive disadvantage in the future and may see thevalue of their storage asset stagnate.\"The study is GRI\\'s most comprehensive look at gas storage markets. Includedis an analysis of changes in storage capacity, services, customer usagepatterns and costs, as well as proposed storage projects. LNG andPropane-Air are covered in addition to traditional types of storagefacilities. The study also reviews future storage requirements, costsassociated with expanding different types of storage capacity, and themerits of different storage locations.The study also looks at storage capacity under existing contracts. Onefinding is that the average length of time until contract expiration forfirm storage contracts has declined from 6.8 years in 1996 to 6.2 years in1999. More than half of the existing contracts in spring 1999 will expireby 2004. By 2006, 70 percent of existing contracts will have expired.Further, storage operators will generally be replacing storage contractsnegotiated by local distribution companies (with guaranteed rates ofreturn) with contracts negotiated by the growing ranks of gas marketers,who are under competitive pressure to hold down costs.The number of years remaining under existing storage contracts varies bycustomer type, according to the study. Currently, cogenerators andindependent power producers have the longest remaining contract lengths,followed by pipelines, gas utilities and marketers. Electric utilities andindustrial customers have the shortest average contract lengths remaining.Listed in the study are the top 50 storage capacity holders.Questions about the study or ordering should be addressed to Kelly Murray,GRI Baseline Center, Arlington, Va., at 703-526-7832; by fax at(GRI-99/0200) can be ordered directly from the GRI Document FulfillmentCenter by fax at 630-406-5995.

State regulators arealso expressing concern about the deal and consumer advocates are predictingits demise.\"There are two alternatives,\" says the Bowen source. \"Lawmakers will eitherfashion a better deal or allow SCE to work out their problems in bankruptcycourt.\"Bowen is the chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities and CommunicationsCommittee.The deal calls for SCE to sell its transmission assets to the stateDepartment of Water Resources (DWR) for 2.3 times its book value or $2.76billion. The agreement also calls for the California Public UtilitiesCommission (PUC) to establish a rate plan so that $3.5 billion of debt couldbe recovered by SCE for its power purchases before the state began buyingelectricity in January.\"This is the single most important cash flow provision of the memorandum ofunderstanding,\" says a source with the state Office of Ratepayer Advocate(ORA). \"SCE will collect all of the costs they have incurred.\" ORA had arguedagainst bailing SCE out of debt saying its parent company had ample funds.In return for the premium paid in excess of the value of its transmissionassets, SCE has agreed to sell the output of its generating plants atcost-based rates.\"Because of the premium, cost-based rates should be lower,\" says the ORAsource.\"The senator is very skeptical,\" says the Bowen source. \"The deal is a greatbenefit for generators and utilities but little, if any, benefit forratepayers.\"The source says there is also concern with the SCE deal because it will onlyinvolve about a third of the 32,000 miles of transmission lines in the state.\"If you buy a third of a bridge don\\'t you wind up getting wet\" asks the Bowensource.Davis has expressed optimism that the state will eventually obtain all of thestate\\'s utility transmission lines. Pacific Gas & Electric\\'s (PG&E)bankruptcy filing has complicated the governor\\'s plan, but Davis says thestate can now obtain the assets through the courts. However, the state mustnow compete with private companies intent on the same thing. Negotiationsbetween the state and San Diego Gas & Electric are continuing.The Bowen source says provisions in the deal which fashion a way forgenerators to collect all they are owed by SCE is also of concern tolawmakers.\"The state\\'s position was that the rates charged by generators were unjustand unreasonable,\" says the source. \"If you now pay the generators you have,at the very least, a public relations problem.\"The source says there may also be a court fight over the issue.\"The creditors dealing with PG&E in bankruptcy court would probably want thesame treatment,\" says the source. \"This creates an intriguing whipsaw effect.\"A bill outlining the terms of the agreement between the state must beintroduced before official consideration begins in the legislature.A source with UCAN says a bill based on the present agreement will never bepassed.\"If it survives, it will be modified,\" says the source., Inside Washington Publishers',\n",

       " 'FYI.Tim Belden@ECTi concur.Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, SarahNovosel/Corp/Enron@Enron, Steve Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron,Ron McNamara/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Brown/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven JKean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@EnronTo the discussion I would add the following -1. Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful.The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonaland intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficultto get the \"right\" zones.  Moreover, in markets like ERCOT, the zonalstructure has been co-opted by the large incumbents to frustrate thedevelopment of the market.2. One solution discussed throughout the East is the \"Hybrid\" model - LMP inthe real-time and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion.  Ifstructured properly, this allows the power desk to have (a) a real-timeenergy market and (b) managable transmission risk.  There are disagreementsbetween the policy \"experts\" about Flowgates (see point 5).3. Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work forEnron.  Key goals - 1. single control area for the RTO, 2. real time energymarket with no penalties for unbalanced positions, 3. market hubs (similar toPJM West) for liquidty, and 4. manageable transmission congestion usingmarket solutions.4. I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with \"one\" perfectmarket structure proposal for Enron (both for technical and timing reasons -California is in a different place than SPP).  We are trying to coordinateour statements in each of the markets as much as possible.  Most importantly,and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately, we need to make sure thatsaying something in one market doesn\\'t damage our other advocacy efforts.Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time andplace and ensure that our messages have the necessary context.5. We still hear some open questions about the best form of market-basedcongestion managment (option vs. obligation; use it or lose it).  ChristiNicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues.  Please contacther if anyone from your teams should attend.Call with any other questions.  At some point, we need to ensure completeagreement of our policy(s) and our advocacy efforts on RTOs.JimKevin M Presto@ECTNovosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, SteveWalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECTAre you putting words in my mouth Tim.The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy marketswith a \"real supply curve\" and a \"real demand curve\" such that hourlyclearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.   Withrespect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that isnecessary, that is subject to much debate.   Although I prefer a zonal modelfor simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent inthe East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real timeenergy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricingis necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created inzones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to makesome progress on the creation of real time energy markets.   The zonalmarkets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in amis-priced commodity with no \"real\" price signal sent to the market.   Out ofmerit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestionis managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is notsent to the market).   This results in a very inefficient commodity marketwhere the consumer gets screwed and market makers can\\'t price the commodityor transportation on a forward basis.I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding.------------------------------------------------Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest visionfor RTO\\'s that was developed by the east desk.  This vision seems to differsomewhat from what we are advocating in the west.  In particular, it seemslike the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted inthe zonal / flow-gate camp.  I have asked Steve to flesh out more details ofthe nodal approach -- in particular, how do the nodes map to a fairlyhomogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions (i.e., atransaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it) versusasset-based trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the tradesettles with the market.It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrantdifferent models.  For example, the west has large, long-distance, highvoltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach.  The east has morelocal transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily.  It alsocould be that the political reality in the east and west require differentpositions.  As things sit now, there is no way that a zonal approach couldfly in the northwest.  In contrast, PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal.Finally, it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a differenceof opinion on what the \"ideal\" market structure should be.  If that is thecase, then perhaps we need to talk some more.Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west, I don\\'tthink that we can come up with a broad, nationwide advocacy position at thistime.  That is, I don\\'t think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as\"the answer\" at FERC.  Instead, I think that we should focus on theobjectives that RTO\\'s should try to achieve and be flexible as to what thebest market structure should be to achieve these objectives.What do you guys think about this?Regards,Tim',\n",

Thank you.Attached is a draft Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") pertaining to our discussionsabout the feasibility and development of an approximate 500 MW power stationsited at or near the Port of Brownsville.  The LOI is structured similarly tothe existing Participation Agreement, wherein BPUB and ENA exclusivelycollaborate to investigate the feasibility of the power station and secure asuitable site, if justified.  It is proposed that ENA cover the costs of thedevelopment effort, including permitting and site acquisition, with suchcosts being eventually treated as either Project construction costs oroperating costs, depending upon the nature of the expense.  I have alsoproposed that ENA pay BPUP a $10,000 Consulting Fee to cover any outsideexpenses associated with the drafting and execution of this agreement and thesite option agreement(s).  The proposed term of the LOI expires 31 December2001, unless either of us determines earlier that the joint effort will notbe successful.  During the term of the LOI, it is proposed that BPUB and ENAwill determine and agree upon an appropriate Project equity participation andfinance structure.Something we may want to consider is the transfer of BPUB\\'s equity in theOklaunion plant in exchange for equity in the new Cameron County plant.  Thiswould be especially appealing if BPUB\\'s interest in Oklaunion also includedswitching rights through the nearby DC Tie and if there are additionalOklaunion interests available with DC Tie switching rights.Please let know a convenient time when we talk through the proposed LOI andaddress any of your questions.JMoore',\n",

Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)The first person from the customer\\'s company logging Online has to acceptETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for allother users.The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up hisusers) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?PA = Password Application, right? Hadn\\'t heard of this until now.3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to getTrading AccessAlternative 1 most closely mirrors what we\\'re doing for our existing customerbase and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control /System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised wecut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signedoff by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort,single point of reference).Any chance of seeing what format the marketing pack / application is in sofar?

Andrew.Wilkinson@cliffordchance.comLast two days showed that there is a big confusion on how exactly theregistration process is going to work. The issue is very important and urgentas it may cause changes to the scope for Agency.com, and changes in the ETAand PA documents text.The registration process appears to differ for different customer groups and,to my understanding, the latest was agreed as below. Please provide your1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)will receive marketing Pack via mail approx. 2 weeks before the system goeslive. The Marketing Pack will include PA (for an appropriate jurisdiction)and Registration Forms with questions about the customer (name, address,e-mail, taxable entity etc.)customers will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to EnronAfter the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receiveIDs and Passwords that customer\\'s Administrator will grant to individualtraders in that companyThe first person from the customer\\'s company logging Online has to acceptETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for allother users.\"House\"?2. Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users) - Regulators, Lawyers,Brokers, Potential Traders etc.will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online, that will beautomatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator. Customers will provideinfo on their name, e-mail address, mailing address, country of incorporationetc.If Enron approves the customer as a Guest user, the System Administrator wille-mail customer Guest ID and Password.When the customer logs in for the  first time as a guest, it\\'ll  have toaccept Read Only ETA on line. Read Only ETA will depend on the guest\\'s placeof incorporation, i.e. the system has to recognise the customer when it logsin and display an appropriate Read Only ETA. Without accepting Read Only ETA\"Guest\" user won\\'t be able to view anything in the House.2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log insession, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC toput an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for alljurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th.3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to informpotential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted.4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed backto Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed offline, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleanerway...3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to getTrading AccessThere are two alternatives possible.Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to tradeonline, i.e. get the ID and PasswordEnron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA forappropriate jurisdictionCustomer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to EnronIf the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive IDsand Passwords that customer\\'s Administrator will grant to individual tradersin that companyThe first person from the customer\\'s company logging Online has to acceptETA.

       " \"james.steffes@enron.comWe had a meeting at Wilmer Cutler's office today to discuss the reply brief(due on July 2).  Attached is the first draft of the brief -- a redraft willbe circulated COB Wednesday which will revise this brief somewhat but notsignificantly.  I will circulate the revised brief once I receive it.  Wilmerasks that we get comments back to them by Noon on Friday.Lou feels very good about New York being defeated in its petition.  Almostall of the intervenor briefs have been against New York, and Lou thinks hecan almost promise that the Court will not rule in favor of New York.With regard to Enron's position, Lou feels that we have the upper handlegally but he is concerned that our position lacks passion -- a reason whythe Court should rule against the regulator.  We talked about ways to augmentthe reply brief to show the court why it must overturn FERC on the bundledretail transmission issue.At the end of the meeting, I asked Lou to give us his best guess at our oddsof prevailing.  Very informally, and somewhat in jest, Lou gives us a 37.5percent chance of winning the bundled transmission argument.  John, anotherattorney at Wilmer working on the brief, gives us a 42 percent chance ofprevailing.  Although these are non-binding, informal estimates, I thoughteveryone would like to hear the odds our Supreme Court council are giving us.Please let me know if you have any comments on the brief by noon on Friday.ThanksSarah- Combined reply draft v6.doc\",\n",

       " 'SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can\\'t?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA \"contract\".  (the utilities ask) You\\'d think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood\\'s friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.Sue-----Original Message-----I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.

Having other documents listed in that sectionmay be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for generaltrading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the\"Other Agreements\" section, to house these other agreements.  Myunderstanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in theMaster Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrongagreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has beenproliferating.

At that time, they felt that it would support the portfolio to around $20 / share.  The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.

Again, I'm sure they would argue the obligation to flow warrents a reduction in their rate, but we could look at the economics compared to the cost of facility modifications.  Over the last year, BRT hasn't scheduled less than 70,000/d on average under that agreement.-----Original Message-----What if we could contract with Agave under the EFBH Rate Schedule for gas from Red Bluff & Bitter Lakes (located north of WT-1 & south of P-1) to deliveries off the south end of the WTX lateral?  Then we could sell westward capacity through WT-1 under Rate Schedule FTS-3.  Agave nominates a total of 50,000/d to 60,000/d from these supply sources into the Central Pool, but this gas does not need to flow through WT-1.  Maybe Agave's existing 40,000/d East could be done under EFBH (if Agave didn't want to commit to incremental firm), but they would have the obligation to flow - I'm sure they would think that merits a rate adjustment.  Anyway, it could be cheaper than some of the options we discussed yesterday or it could be something we would want to do in addition to modifications to WT-1 (for Red Rock & PNM deals).Kevin, let's get together Monday so I can fill you in on the status of WT-1 capacity.\",\n",

First of all,  Irequested meetings with the audit and EHS folks to understand our proceduresand our status.  So, no fair ranting at Don.  Secondly, your note brings tomind what I find the most troublesome about our process as it currentlystands.  It is not now, nor will it be in the future the audit department\\'sresponsibility to ensure that corrective actions are taken as a result of theaudit process.  It is the responsibility of the business leader and thebusiness management.  So, follow up with the companies should have been acommunication from you to the business unit head, not from Don to thebusiness and Don to you.But, we are going to work all of this out and in the meantime, we aren\\'tgoing to get crosswise with each other.  This is going to be an \"open kimono\"kind of place and no information is going to be managed away from me.  I willbe staying on top of things and I will be involved with all of the supportgroups, with the business leaders and with the executive managment..  And,problems that are uncovered will be owned by all of us responsible for thebusiness and the appropriate handling of those issues will be a matter ofperformance between the business and myself.So, please, calm down and let\\'s all get off on the right foot.  Enjoy yourholiday, darn it!RebeccaPeter E Weidler@ENRONMcDonald/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTDon - really - this kind of upsets me - I thought you were going to call meif we were having any problems - this report looks like crap and is notreflective of actual status - I know TGS has completed most of itsoutstanding items -  Does your team call and follow up with the individualcompanies - requesting a status report ?    If so give me the names of whocalled and who you talked to  and the date of the call.   What is the concernabout Cuiaba - they got a 90 + score -  TGS and Centragas are in SouthAmerica - not carribbean.   Why did you not list the scores ?     Really - Ithink this report and the handling of transmitting this information iscompletely different from my understanding of our understanding of how thisis supposed to work.    You were going to follow up with the companies andlet me know if there were any problems and I was going to go fix the problems-  Report says there are problems and the first I hear of it is when  you goand report to my bosses.   This does not begin to reflect the concepts we haddiscussed.PeteDon HawkinsShields/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTGuys, for your information and a heads up.

       " 'peter.keohane@enron.com, garrett.tripp@enron.competer.keohane@enron.com, garrett.tripp@enron.comYesterday I attended the initial Ontario Standard Physical Bilateral ContractThe main debate in the meeting was with respect to whether \"physical\"transactions were possible in Ontario given the market rules.  Ontario PowerGeneration Inc. (OPG) put forth the premise that all transactions involvingthe pool are financial.  I led the charge that the pool was simply asettlement mechanism yet the underlying transactions are physical in nature.OPG supported a  form of master which essentially a much boiled down ISDA.  Isupported the Canadianized EEI form that Greg has put together.Jack Lubec of the IMO made a powerpoint presentation on how transactions aresettled and his interpretation of the physical/financial issue.  A copy ofthe presentation is attached hereto.The group (which included TransCanada, TransAlta, AMPCO (industrials), HydroOne (transco), the IMO, several consultants and lawyers) seemed unable toagree with either position and decided that the market in Ontario was ahybrid market (a position that in practice may be correct but in terms oflegal obligations is nonsensical).The IMO advised that Revenue Canada does not take title to power, does nottake possession of power and the pool transactions are deemed not\"derivatives\".  Notwithstanding this direction, some in the group seemed toaccept the OPG assertion that as a generator can choose not to generate (inwhich case the pool will supply on the generator\\'s behalf and charge thegenerator) and/or a would be load can choose not to receive (in which casethe pool treats this as a resale to the pool and pays the load for energy notconsumed) and that a supplier has no ability to guarantee physical deliverythat the market is financial.  I refuted this premise but only found supportfrom TransAlta.Notwithstanding the lack of consensus on the physical/financial issue thegroup did agree with my position that many market participants did not havethe requisite corporate authority to do derivative or financial transactionsand those that did may not be comfortable with or even understand a financialtrading document.  All in the group supported this position.  Thus,it islikely that the starting point, if not the Enron Canada EEI form, will be thebase EEI form.  Many supported an Ontario only document but accepted theposition if possible a multi-jurisdictional standard base agreement would bepreferred.The group tentatively accepted me and Dan Pastoric of Hydro One as theco-chairs of the drafting committee.  This is subject to confirmation at thenext meeting which is scheduled for December 6th.Elizabeth - I suggest that you and I may want to prepare some sort of memosetting out why the market is physical and not financial.  I think that tothe extent that you (or someone in your group) can provide a commentary whyothers pools (California, NEPOOL,...) are still physical markets, I may bebetter equipped to convince the group.Greg - I suggest that until we are closer to market opening in Ontario thatthe form of power master that we circulate in Alberta not include the OntarioFirm (LD) product definition as this will likely be modified through theOSPBC process.RegardsCJG',\n",

I have a couple of ideas but I really wantto mull it over.They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could youforward the draft change orders with it?One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to haveus refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money),retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They areputting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, andsince the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably beacceptable to GE.Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.
